<h2>Control Flow - Part II</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In Part I of this article we discussed the basics of control
flow: gotos, labels, conditional branching, and looping. In Part
II, we'll discuss two other methods of control flow: subroutines
and recursion. By adding these two methods of control flow to our
methods of working, we'll be able to encapsulate code into easily
reusable chunks as well as be able to express the possibility of
having code branch out to a copy of itself, which will allow a
certain Csound technique which is not possible any other way
(instantiating and using a variable number of opcodes).</p>

<h2>III. Subroutines: User-Defined Opcodes</h2>

<p>So far, we have taken looks at a few ways to control the flow
within one body of code. However, it is often useful to package
up code into its own named resource and to call that code from
within the main body of code, diverting away temporarily from the
main code body to another body of code, then returning back to
the main code body. To do this, we make <i>subroutines</i>, a
named body of code that we can call to from any other body of
code and that will return back to the main body of code. With a
subroutine we can identify its meaning with a clear and useful
name (i.e. this code inverts an ftable, so we'll call the
subroutine <code>ftableInvert</code>), and also easily reuse the
code amongst different instruments and different projects. In
Csound, we are able to use subroutines by using the User-Defined
Opcode system.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the last code example from Part I:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
itable = 1
itablesize = ftlen(itable)
i_index = 0

loopStart:


ival tablei i_index, itable
ival = ival * -1
tableiw ival, i_index, itable

loop_lt i_index, 1, itablesize, loopStart
</pre>
</div>

<p>This code has been set up to be very easily reusable. If you
wanted to take this code and use with another ftable, all you
would have to do is make a copy and change what ftable you were
working on by reassigning itable to another number (on the first
line). Beyond that one variable, all of the rest of the code is
setup to work without change.</p>

<p>By simply copying and pasting it would be easy to reuse this
code, and if it was something that was very specific to a
particular instrument design and you knew that you weren't going
to use this code often, you might simply go that route of copying
and pasting. However, there are some drawback to just copying and
pasting:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're using two copies of this code in the same
instrument, you would have to rename the loopStart label for each
time this bit of code is reused in the same instrument, as you
can't have two of the same label in the same instrument</li>

<li>If you were going to paste this code into a different
instrument, you would have to carefully check that all of the
variable names you have used in this code do not clash with other
variables you have already used in the instrument</li>

<li>If you have a lot of code you like to reuse, it can be
tedious to copy and paste so much code</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if we take this code and encapsulate it into a
subroutine--in the case of Csound, we would use the User-Defined
Opcode system--we could give this set of code an easily
identified name and pass information into the subroutine as well
as get information out of the subroutine. Then, anytime we wanted
to use this code, we would only have to call it like any other
opcode in Csound.</p>

<p>Creating a UDO(User-Defined Opcode), we also wouldn't have to
worry about the problems of renaming labels or clashing variable
names, as that information stays local to the UDO code.
Consequently, the UDO does not know about information in the
calling instrument or UDO, so you have to pass in information as
well as return information from the UDO. We <i>could</i> use
global variables which all code can see, but that's generally a
bad practice for this kind of coding so is not encouraged. We'll
look at the passing-in and returning values more later.</p>

<p>User-Defined Opcodes, like normal opcodes that come with
Csound, have a name as well as out arguments and in arguments.
When calling the opcode, out arguments come first (if there are
any), then the name of the opcode to be called, and then finally
the in arguments. To define a User-Defined Opcode, we define it
like this:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">opcode</span> <span
style="font-style: italic;">opname</span>, <span style=
"font-style: italic;">outargtypes</span>, <span style=
"font-style: italic;">inargtypes</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">inargs</span> <span style=
"font-weight: bold;"> xin</span>

        <i>...code...</i>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">xout</span> <span style=
"font-style: italic;">outarg</span>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">endop</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>The first line starts with "opcode" which tells Csound we're
defining a User-Defined Opcode. After that is the name ofthe
opcode we're making. Since we have code that inverts an ftable,
we'll name our opcode "ftableInvert". Following that comes a
definition of types of input arguments as a series of letters to
define what kind of arguments ftable invert will return as
output, as well as another definition of input argument types.
(The argument types we are allowed to use are defined in the
manual <a href=
"http://csounds.com/manual/html/opcode.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Getting back to our code, we know that we want to be able to
reuse this code with any ftable, simply by telling what ftable
number this code is supposed to use. The code runs on the ftable
itself so after its is finished, there is nothing in the code
that will be required to be returned. Knowing this, we know that
for the UDO definition, we need to set it so it takes in one
irate variable (the ftable number), and returns nothing.</p>

<p>Here's what our code would look like as a UDO:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
        opcode ftableInvert 0, i
itable  xin


itablesize  = ftlen(itable)
i_index     = 0


loopStart:


ival    tablei i_index, itable
ival    = ival * -1
        tableiw ival, i_index, itable 

loop_lt i_index, 1, itablesize, loopStart

    endop
</pre>
</div>

<p>In the opcode declaration on the first line, the code
translates to "create an opcode named <code>ftableInvert</code>
with 0 out arguments and 1 in argument of type i". The second
line with xin collects the input values and assigns them to
variables within the UDO; we have only one input argument of type
i and we assign it to the variable itable. The code that follows
that does the inversion of the ftable should be familiar from
Part I of this article. We complete the opcode definition with
"endop", thus creating our own opcode using Csound code.</p>

<p>To call this UDO, we do so in the same way we call any other
opcode in Csound. Because Csound (and most programming languages)
interpret as they read code line by line, we have to make sure
that we define the UDO before we use it in our instruments.</p>

<p>In the example below, all of this would be in either the ORC
file or within the &lt;CsInstruments&gt; tags in a CSD file.</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
/* BEGIN USER-DEFINED OPCODES */
    opcode ftableInvert 0, i
itable  xin

itablesize = ftlen(itable)
i_index = 0

loopStart:

ival    tablei i_index, itable
ival = ival * -1
tableiw ival, i_index, itable 

loop_lt i_index, 1, itablesize, loopStart

    endop

/* BEGIN ORCHESTRA */
    instr 1

itable1 = p4
itable2 = p5

ftableInvert itable1
ftableInvert itable2

    endin
</pre>
</div>

<p>We have started off by defining the <code>ftableInvert</code>
UDO, then later on in instr 1, we use that opcode we made just
like we call any other opcode in Csound.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Be careful when naming your opcodes! If you create a UDO that
has the same name of one that comes with Csound, the UDO will
become the one that gets used whenever Csound searches for that
opcode. If two UDO's are named the same, Csound will use the UDO
definition it read in last. This can be a source of problems if
you are using UDO's and decide to use someone else's instrument
that may also be using their own UDO's but have the same names as
yours. You can try making your UDO's unique by prepending your
name or a project name, i.e. "yi_env1", "nameOfPiece_filter",
etc.</li>

<li>UDO's can call other UDO's as long as the UDO they are
calling have already been read in by Csound. (UDO's can even call
themselves, which will be demonstrated in the next section.)</li>
</ul>

<p>UDO's are a powerful way to create your own opcodes and make
it easy to reuse code you commonly use. You can also find many
UDO's to study and use at the Csound UDO Repository <a href=
"http://www.csounds.com/udo">here</a> on <a href=
"http://www.csounds.com">Csounds.com</a>.</p>

<p>Now that we've seen how to make subroutines out of Csound code
using User-Defined Opcodes, let's take a look at a programming
technique using UDO's that call themselves, and how that can be
useful to you in your own work.</p>

<h2>IV. Recursion</h2>

<p>In Part I of this article we saw how to use iteration (loops)
to handle doing a task a variable number of times, but there is
another technique to achieve the same effect: recursion.
Recursion in programming refers to when a function or subroutine
calls itself. Most things which can be expressed using iteration
can also be done using a recursive function and vice versa.
Recursion is often noted for its <i>elegance</i> in expressing an
algorithm, but also noted for performance inefficiencies. While
most things that require a variable number of operations can be
expressed by either iteration or recursion, there usually are
cases where one would work better than another. Before we get
into discussing the merits of either way of coding, let's take a
look at how to use recursion.</p>

<p>The example CSD below has an instrument that uses Additive
Synthesis to create a sound. The primary sound generation comes
from the yi_add_table UDO that reads a set of partial numbers and
strengths from an ftable and uses an oscil3 with a sine ftable to
generate the signal. You might be asking why aren't we using a
simple gen10 ftable with a single oscil3: the instrument applies
different powers of a 0-1 scaled envelope to each partial
individually, so the application of amplitude must happen on a
per-partial basis.</p>

<p>The code below makes lower partials stronger during lower
volumes and have higher partials come in quickly as the amplitude
rises. NOTE: the implementation isn't great and modifications
could be made to introduce a scaling factor so that how strong
the higher partials synthesize could be dependent on amplitude
(quieter notes are darker while louder notes are brighter) but
that is beyond the scope of this article).</p>

<p>The example is as follows:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
/* Generates a signal from an ftable using additive synthesis */

&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;

&lt;CsInstruments&gt;

&lt;/CsScore&gt;

&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;

</pre>
</div>

<p>I have hilighted above in red the recursive call: you can see
that the yi_add_table opcode calls itself! If you haven't seen
code like this you might be thinking to yourself, "Okay, so I
call this UDO and starts at the beginning of the UDO and when it
gets to the call to itself, it starts at the beginning of the UDO
again and when it gets to the call to itself it... Wait! Isn't
this going to go on infinitely?". Well, if the code doesn't have
any way to stop it from calling itself, then yes, it would be an
infinite loop. However, in the example above, if you look at the
if statement that surrounds the call to itself, you'll see that
it is checking if the i_index that's being passed in to the UDO
is less than the size of the ftable. That's the check that will
eventually terminate the UDO calls to itself and start returning
back to where it was called from.</p>

<p>In the example, the yi_add_table opcode is set to take in an
ftable number, a k-rate envelope signal, a k-rate frequency
signal, and an optional i_index parameter that defaults to 0. In
the calling instrument (instr 1) we see how that UDO is called
without an i_index. So if we follow along the code, the first
time the UDO is called i_index defaults to 0, then in the UDO
when it calls itself, it does so but adding 2 to the current
i_index. If you keep thinking through this, the i_index will keep
increasing each time the UDO calls itself until the test
comparing i_index and itablesize will fail and the recursive call
to the UDO starts to unwind back to the original UDO call.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Notable Code</span></p>

<p>There is also two other interesting sections of code. The
first is a a loop:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
loopStart:

kenv_local = kenv_local * kenv

loop_lt kcount, 2, i_index + 2, loopStart
</pre>
</div>

<p>The loop allows us to multiply kenv by itself n number of
times where n is what number of the partial we're currently
synthesizing. This is what gives the envelope its slope for every
partial. While we certainly could have redone this code to also
use recursion, I wanted to do this within the body of the UDO and
not have a separate UDO for this part of the code. There is also
another reason to not use recursion here, namely that of memory
and function call overhead, but that will explained later in the
article. It's enough to know that on the whole, using loops is
more efficient than recursion and recursion should only be used
in special circumstances.</p>

<p>The second section of code I wanted to highlight is:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
if (i_index == 0) then
    aout balance aout, asig
endif
</pre>
</div>

<p>This section of code allows us balance out the overall signal
with the signal strength of the first partial. By checking what
i_index we're currently on, this code will not run unless we're
in the initial call of the UDO. If we follow through the code,
what happens is that instrument 1 initially calls the
yi_add_table UDO and is expecting a signal to be generated. Each
call to the UDO will return a signal to that which called it,
whether it is a UDO or an instrument. When the UDO calls itself,
it collects the generated signal of the UDO it called and mixes
it with the signal the current UDO itself generates. Since I only
wanted to call balance when all the signals are collected up, the
code is set up to check where we are in the UDO calls: in this
case, if i_index is equal to 0, we know we are in the UDO that is
synthesizing the original partial, therefore, call the balance
opcode.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When to Use
Recursion</span></p>

<p>Recursion is often considered elegant in programming and it is
also particularly effective when working with tree data
structures, though that doesn't happen too often in Csound and
likely won't be a concern for most users. However, recursion
comes with a price of more memory and function call overhead than
iteration (the explanation of this is beyond the scope of this
article, but many texts on this can be found on the Internet). In
general, iteration is faster and requires less memory than
recursion, therefore it is recommended to solve problems using
iteration first and only then use recursion when necessary in
Csound.</p>

<p>If iteration is faster and more efficient to use than
recursion, why use recursion at all? Beyond the general elegance
of expressing an algorithm using recursion, there is a very
specific reason in Csound to use it that has to do with opcodes
and how Csound is implemented under the hood.</p>

<p>If we try to write the above additive synth code in a loop
like so:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
kcount = 0
aout = 0

loopStart:

kenv_local = kenv_local * kenv

kfreq   tablei kcount, itable
kamp    tablei kcount + 1, itable

kfreq   = kpch * kfreq

<span style=
"color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">asig   oscil3 kamp, kfreq, gi_sine</span>
aout    = aout + asig

loop_lt kcount, 2, itablesize, loopStart
</pre>
</div>

<p>At first it seems like this code should work: clear the aout
variable in the beginning of this performance pass, then in a
loop synthesize using oscil3 and add that signal to the aout,
then after the loop is done output the collected output. However,
this will not work: We will get sound out, but it certainly won't
be what we expected!</p>

<p>The reasons for why this does not work are a bit technical to
explain so I will do so in the following section. For the purpose
of this article though, I think it is enough to know that to call
a variable number of opcodes, one <span style=
"font-style: italic;">must</span> do it using a UDO that
recursively calls itself if the opcodes. The only exception to
this is if the opcode does not maintain any state (i.e. a UDO
that just returns a value only depending on what is being passed
in), but on the whole, the above rule will apply.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Technical
Explanation</span></p>

<p>The line of code in red above--the call to oscil3 within the
loop--at first glance may seem like it might work. The problem I
think is that sometimes when we call opcodes it feels like we are
calling a function, when really it is more like a call to a
method of an object. When Csound compiles the above code excerpt,
the opcode line in red is really only created once within the
loop block. Most opcodes like oscil3 involve stateful data as
properties, in this case the current phase in reading the ftable,
and the opcodes are made with the assumption that they will only
get called once per performance pass.</p>

<p>If we call an opcode multiple times in a performance pass,
even with different parameters, it's internal information will be
updated that many multiple number of times. Under normal
conditions Csound will run and assemble a buffers worth of audio
data, output it, then grab more on the next performance pass.
Now, lets say the above loop is supposed to run eight times
before exiting, by calling the opcode eight times and collecting
the data, it's as if we are generating ahead eight buffers worth
of audio data and mixing it together, but also throwing in
different parameters on each call to the opcode. It won't yield
the affect of having eight different oscillators.</p>

<p>Csound opcodes are made up of a data struct and functions
which process using that struct passed in. This is how most
object systems are done in C. So in compiling the orc code with
the loop above, Csound will only allocate one struct for that
line of code. Now, as that struct is really acting as an object,
calling it eight times is as if calling a method on an object
eight times, and since the object's method has side-effects in
updating the objects state, we can see that having opcodes that
have stateful information in a loop is not safe to use.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We've looked at a number of ways to controlling the flow of
operation in Csound instrument code. By knowing these tools, we
will be able to write instrument code that can handle more
complicated needs of the user, as well as more easily write
reusable code. I hope you've enjoyed these articles introducing
the techniques of branching, looping, subroutines, and recursion,
and that they serve you well in helping to express your musical
ideas.</p>
