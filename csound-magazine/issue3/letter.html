<div id="content">
<p>With this late Summer 2006 edition of <i>Csound Journal</i>,
Steven Yi and myself have reached a milestone. We have helped to
post four new editions of articles devoted to Csound over the
last year, and this has been quite alot of work with all the
coding and development, physically moving to different parts of
the planet, and rapid new releases of Csound that have taken
place over the past year. We are very excited about this issue's
articles and are looking very forward to your continuing
contributions to the Journal.<br>
<br>
That said, however, I'd like to offer up an interesting idea
about peer reviews. What do you think about submitting the
Journal to a board of reviewers to give the articles more
credibility? Would that help the authors, or not? While we're not
at the side-bar advertising level yet, and pumping revenue back
into paying for the web site hosts for the Journal, peer reviews
by our esteemed community of Csound experts might eventually
raise the level of awareness for the Journal which belongs to
you. Or perhaps you'd prefer to keep it somewhat informal,
anything goes, rants, raves, and soundoffs etc. Let us hear from
you.</p>

<p>Looking back at the articles since we started the Journal, I
am both very excited and amazed at all of the many ways that
people look at Csound and how they are all using this wonderful
program. I have also learned a great deal in reading these
articles on all levels of my musical knowledge and want thank
everyone who has contributed thus far for their generosity in
sharing.</p>

<p>When I first discovered Csound I was very excited to find a
tool that would really fit with what I was interested in
musically, as well as finding a tool I knew would be able to
handle all of the interests I would grow to have in the future.
After years of working with Csound I find myself as
excited&mdash;if not more so&mdash;about the musical
expressiveness of this program.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this issue's articles as much as we did in
reading and writing them, and am already looking forward to
seeing your contributions for the next Journal!</p>
