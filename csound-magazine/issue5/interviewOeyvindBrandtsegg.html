<h2>Thoughts and Experiences with The Flyndre</h2>

<h3>An Interview with &Oslash;yvind Brandtsegg</h3>

<div id="content"><strong>SY: Hi &Oslash;yvind!
Thank you very much for taking the time to do this interview regarding
your new installation "Flyndre". Before we begin on the installation,
could you start off by telling us a little bit about yourself?</strong><br>

<br>

&Oslash;B: I'm a Norwegian musician/composer/programmer. I have no
formal education in programming, but have picked up what I know about
programming on the basis of musical needs as I went along. I started
out as a drummer in rock bands in the 1980's, and this has probably
formed my musical preferences to great extent. In the 90's, I wanted to
study music at the jazz department of the Conservatory in Trondheim
(now NTNU). I switched to vibraphone for the jazz studies, as I figured
my drumming style was somewhat heavy for jazz. I soon realized that the
vibraphone did not in itself provide sonic variation enough for what I
wanted musically. I wanted to have some rougher sounds at my disposal
in addition to the niceness of the vibraphone sound. I started to use
electronics to process the vibe, along the same lines a guitarist would
do to an electric guitar. In 1994 I started using midi triggers on the
vibe, using hardware synthesizers and samplers as sound sources. I soon
realized that I had not time to physically push buttons on the
synthesizer (e.g. to change patches or to use modulation controller)
while playing the vibe with two mallets in each hand. I started looking
into using sensors for physical gesture control. I tried a lot of
different gear, and ended up using a combination of infrared distance
sensors and EMG sensors measuring muscle strain. I had a lot of help
from the Trondheim based company Soundscape Studios in finding the
right equipment. I started using the software MAX to process the
signals from the sensors, and also to do some algorithmic
composition/automation. My setup at that time (1995 to 1997) consisted
of acoustic vibes with piezo pickups for audio and MIDI, MAX on a Mac
laptop, a Korg Wavestation, and a Roland sampler. I implemented my
first improvisation-processing MAX patches in 1997, testing out the
interplay between my improvising and the computer as a counterpart
musician. Then I discovered Csound, sometime around 1996.<br>

<br>

I realized that the computers I could afford would not provide the
necessary CPU power to be used in realtime performance for audio
synthesis, but I anticipated that the computers would be fast enough by
the time I had learned how to use Csound. In 1998 I started using
Csound as my main audio synthesis engine for live performances, on a
40kg heavy rack mount computer. In the beginning I had to back it up
with a hardware sampler to allow the necessary polyphony. I still used
MAX for control purposes on a Mac, running Csound on a PC platform.<br>

<br>

After a while I grew impatient with what I experienced as instabilities
with MAX, and at the same time my Mac laptop was damaged beyond repair
on a tour. I reimplemented my MAX control routines in Csound, and have
used Csound exclusively ever since. In 2000 I got a commission for a
work for Choir and electronics, and I saw the chance to use that
commission to develop a live sampler for improvised work. This is what
later became ImproSculpt. Since then, I've been researching the
interplay between improvised performance and computer processing,
trying to develop a responsive machine-musician that can both follow my
improvisation and provide musical challenges that influence the way I
play by requiring me to react to the machine's output.<br>

<br>

I've currently exchanged the vibraphone for a Marimba Lumina, and
exchanged the rack mount computer for a laptop, bringing down my total
weight of personal luggage from 160kg to a mere 30-40 kg. Hehe, life
has indeed become easier in that respect.<br>

<p> <strong>SY: Could you tell us about where you are now
and what you are working on?</strong> </p>

<p>&Oslash;B: Since 2004, I've worked in a research position
hosted by NTNU, allowing me to further investigate the use of computers
to implement a compositionally enabled instrument for improvised
performance. By compositionally enabled, I mean that some composition
techniques are implemented in the instrument, allowing for some
automation of the intellectual or mathematical aspects of composition,
while using the improvised input as raw material for the compositional
processes in realtime. My research position is an equivalent to a PhD,
but it is based more firmly on artistic research, relaxing the formal
academic aspects of a traditional PhD.<br>

<br>

</p>

<p> <strong>SY: The work on "compositional techniques
implemented in the instrument" seems that it is heading towards a live
manipulation of compositional algorithms in the same way that one
performs with acoustic instruments, in that there would be a similar
development of intuition and familiarity with working with the
compositional techniques as one develops within the parameter space of
performing on a physical instrument.&nbsp; Would you say this is
where you are heading or is it less deterministic than that?</strong>
</p>

<p>&Oslash;B: I would say this is exactly what I try to do.
Intuition and familiarity are important aspects of improvised
performance, and my main goal is to extend the vocabulary for (my)
improvisation by incorporating compositional strategies and techniques.
<br>

<br>

I find that a lot of fellow improviser musicians are reluctant to
thinking in terms of a musically based intellectual construct, but most
of them start to think of it as a refreshing approach once they get
more familiar with the sound of it. Take serial techniques for example,
strictly used, they provide rigid rules for the development of the
music. But the interesting point for an improviser is that the serial
technique lends a certain "sonic imprint" that is pretty robust to
improvised modifications of the original series. Maybe I'm being too
abstract or fuzzy about my explanation, but what I intend to describe
is that one can hear the "sonic taste" of a serially developed motif,
even if the rules are relaxed somewhat. I tend to think about this in
the same way that harmony and melody is treated in traditional jazz
improvisations. When a musician starts to learn about jazz
improvisation and harmony, there are pretty strict rules about what
notes can be played on what chords. As one learns more, each and every
rule can be bent and changed to the extent that a skilled performer
never thinks about rules and most certainly violates them. A tasteful
violation of rules is part of what is considered a personal style in
any kind of performance.<br>

<br>

I want the instrument to be as deterministic as possible, giving the
exact same response to the same stimuli each and every time. That said,
as with acoustic instruments, I look for a complex interplay of subtle
nuances in stimuli leading to a rich palette of potential for
expression. The rules governing the instrument's response to various
stimuli can be complex, and a performer will need to practice to gain
control of the instrument. It might seem to the inexperienced player
that the instrument behaves in non-deterministic ways. But this is the
same as one would experience when learning to play an acoustic
instrument.<br>

<br>

<br>

</p>

<p> <strong>AK: Can you offer any tips to other computer
music composers who might be interested in going the same route?</strong>
</p>

<p>FW: I would say try to find performers who are open minded and
interested in trying different things. And maybe most of all,
performers who want to make a piece their own - they are the people who
will find things in your music that you didn't know were there!</p>

<p>On a practical note, it's also important that you make your
music not only do-able, but something that people might actually become
involved in trying to do. For example, most performers I know are not
terrifically interested in playing pieces where they have to coordinate
with super-precision, down to the half-second, with a tape part. Its
not something that comes naturally, and although a great performer will
be able to do it, he or she will not be able to help feeling somewhat
resistant; whereas if you build in flexibility, you allow the performer
room to move, to be creative, and to feel. <br>

<br>

</p>

<p> <strong>SY: Regarding your new installation work
"Flyndre", how much does your work regarding improvisation play a
part?&nbsp; I know that Flyndre uses environmental data as data
sources rather than human interaction.&nbsp; Do you view the
sources of information as very different when you are working?</strong>
</p>

<p>&Oslash;B: Actually, I view the sources of information as
similar. The environmental data are used in place of human input. This
might seem strange, because the success of the human interaction with
the instrument relies heavily on the musical abilities of the human,
and the environmental data does not possess any musical knowledge
whatsoever. I do take care in planning what parameters the
environmental data should be able to control, and as such I view the
data mapping as a large part of the compositional work with an
installation. The musical knowledge is built into the instrument as
part of the data mapping.<br>

<br>

</p>

<p> <strong>SY: Taking a step back, could you tell us a
little bit about Flyndre? (What motivated the project, how did it
develop, challenges of such a large project)</strong> </p>

<p>&Oslash;B: The Flyndre is a sound installation situated in
Inder&oslash;y, Norway. It is based upon an existing aluminium
sculpture by Nils Aas. The music for the sound installation is in
constant evolution during the exhibition period of 10 years, affected
by environmental data (light, temperature, tide, moon phase etc). Most
of the technical equipment is placed in Trondheim, some two hours away
from the physical installation site, streaming sensor and audio signals
between the two sites. The reason for putting the equipment in
Trondheim is practical, to avoid having to put a computer in an outside
environment in a public park. Also, a nice side effect of this setup is
that we can stream the audio from the installation to the webpage for
the project.<br>

<br>

In 2003, I had been working on another large sound installation in
collaboration with the Norwegian composer Christian Eggen. This was
situated in a public park (Vigelandsparken) in Oslo. There are a lot of
sculptures by Gustav Vigeland in that park, but we did not make any of
the sound installations relate to the sculptures. I kind of like the
idea of placing a sound installation in a public space, where it can be
experienced more "as is" than what would be the case if it is placed in
a museum or gallery space. This is because the expectations of the
viewer/audience are different in this context. Also, in a public park,
there are other sounds that merge with the sounds from the
installation, and I like the idea that the audience can be unsure if
some of the sounds come from the environment or the installation. <br>

<br>

I also view sound installation as one way to regain the "original" of a
work, in these times when digital copying is so common and music
recordings have somewhat lost the status of an original object. The
audio track for a sound installation can of course be copied, but the
full work is only ever present at the physical installation site.<br>

<br>

At the same time, in 2003, I started looking more closely at the
Flyndre sculpture by Nils Aas. The sculpture was made by Aas in 2000
and it is situated in Inder&oslash;y, some two hours north of
Trondheim. The Flyndre sculpture is made of aluminium bands, almost
like a scaled-up version of a wire frame sculpture. The aluminium in
the sculpture is resonant, and tapping on different parts of the
sculpture makes a variety of sounds and resonances. Through Soundscape
Studios in Trondheim, I had become aware of the NXT flat panel speaker
technique. This is based on using a small exciter element to transfer
audio as vibrations into an object, making the object into a
loudspeaker. The original idea for the Flyndre sound installation was
inspired by this simple combination of a speaker technique and a
resonating object (the sculpture). I contacted Nils Aas to discuss the
project with him, and he was very enthusiastic about me bringing
another dimension into his work. Sadly, Nils died in 2004 and never got
to hear the installation.<br>

<br>

An early challenge in the project was raising money. In hindsight, it
seems to me like one of the most important parts in raising the money
was expressing the artistic ideas in writing, in such a way that
bureaucrats would "get the point" and be interested in contributing to
the project. I always find it hard to express artistic ideas in
writing, because the concepts involved may be somewhat abstract and in
any case audio is my preferred way of expressing the ideas, not text. I
had a lot of help from my producer Kulturbyr&aring;et
Mes&eacute;n; they really helped me focus my ideas into a written
project description.<br>

<br>

Another interesting aspect of the Flyndre project is the large number
of contributors, as 35 to 40 people have been directly involved in the
making of the sound installation. Sensor design, computer programming,
financing, electricity cabling, equipment housing (outdoors), internet
connections, audio streaming solutions, web design, these are just
examples of the tasks that other people have done for me. It would take
too long to give a detailed list here, but there's some more
information on the web page www.flyndresang.no. Without all the help, I
would not have been able to complete the project, and at the same time,
it has been quite a new experience for me trying to coordinate the
efforts of so many people. <br>

<br>

</p>

<p> <strong>SY: That is really quite a large group of
people to coordinate!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really amazing what went
into putting together this installation. Would you describe some of the
challenges you found in working on such a large project?</strong>
</p>

<p>&Oslash;B: In general, there were challenges related to
managing deadlines for different parts of the project that relied on
each other, e.g. getting the network connections in Inder&oslash;y
ready at the same time as the systems in Trondheim to be able to test
the network connections and so on. I find that in all projects like
this, even if you have a budget, you will rely on the favours and
goodwill of people involved. You oftentimes have to ask people to do a
little more than what they are paid to do, and still do it on time.
Working on a long timescale (the Flyndre project took 3 years from
conception to opening) does not necessarily help, because most people
tend to postpone a task until the last minute anyway. This is probably
just the result of everyone having a crowded time schedule, but I
realized it might be wise to set deadlines with this in
mind&hellip; <br>

<br>

Bug fixing my software has been a challenge in this project, as the
software runs on university servers and the hardware is locked inside
server rooms. Installation and configuration has to be done remotely
via network, and in the event that my software crashes the computer, I
have to call someone to physically lock themselves into the server room
and hard reboot. One should think that this was not frequently
necessary, but the software has behaved quite differently on a server
than on my laptop, giving rise to a generous amount of hard reboots
being necessary ;-) One of the most frequent issues has been related to
threading in Python, and the server has proved to be much more
sensitive to these issues than my laptop.<br>

<br>

When working at night, I could not call the service staff for the
university computers in case something went wrong. At times when I
needed to do a soft reboot of the server via remote connection, it felt
somewhat like a scene out of a sci-fi movie. I&rsquo;m thinking of
scenes where the spacecraft is going into radio shadow for several
minutes while circling the far side of a planet. When issuing a reboot
from a remote connection, there&rsquo;s not much you can do if the
machine for some reason should have problems booting. And the only
thing you can look at is the &ldquo;not connected&rdquo;
message blinking while the machine reboots. I guess this might be an
everyday situation for server techs, but for me it was unnerving enough
when programming at night during the last phase of the project.<br>

<br>

The composition of a piece of music with duration of 10 years has been
a conceptual challenge for me. Trying to get a firm grip on the large
time span has been interesting indeed. Even if the music is
algorithmic, and a lot of variations are modulated via the parameter
inputs, it still requires quite an extensive library of material for
the software to create variations from. I've also wanted to create
local variations creating a listening experience for the "one-time
2-minute listener", as well as creating long-term evolution.<br>

<br>

I won&rsquo;t bore you with all the details about specific
parameter mappings, but a few general points might be of interest. One
of the input parameters used is the tidal water, because the Flyndre
sculpture is situated by a tidal stream. This looks somewhat like a
broad river, but every six hours, the water changes direction and start
flowing the other way. I think of this as a huge low frequency
oscillator. Water speed, flow direction and water level are used as
derivative parameters from the movement of the tides. Also relating to
the tides is the phases of the moon, and I&rsquo;ve mapped it so
that there&rsquo;s a lot more dense activity in the composition at
the time of full moon, and a more relaxed musical attitude at the time
of new moon.<br>

<br>

During this project, I&rsquo;ve built a completely new base for my
software instrument ImproSculpt, starting from scratch. It is great fun
writing compositional software and composing with it at the same time,
as the interaction of the two processes can enrich both the composition
and the programming. I guess you must have had similar experiences when
working with Blue?<br>

</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">SY: Certainly!</span>
<br>

</p>

<p>&Oslash;B: At the same time, it is easy (for me) to get
lost, spending days on implementing a tiny detail in software and
losing track of the overall compositional goal. <br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">SY: Again, certainly!
(*laughs*) I think it&rsquo;s really easy for anyone who creates
their own tools for music making to get lost working on them and not
spending enough time working with them.&nbsp; [A wise piece of
advice Michael Gogins told me very early on in my programming career.]</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Could you tell us a
little bit more about how Csound was used in your project?</span><br>

&nbsp;<br>

&Oslash;B: I&rsquo;ve used the Csound API with Python as a
host. All the compositional logic, GUI, sensor interface and program
control is implemented in Python, while Csound is used for the audio
synthesis. I&rsquo;ve had timing problems with Python, and one of
my next tasks will be to implement a better sequencing timer. I will
probably port all time critical functions to Csound, and rely on
control rate timing. I plan on separating the application into at least
three standalone programs, one each for GUI, logic, and audio
synthesis. The three applications will then communicate via TCP.<br>

<br>

A lot of the Csound programming could be considered straightforward,
with oscillators, sample playback, filters and effects. I&rsquo;ve
deliberately used some retro sounding instruments, for example
mellotron samples and a fof voice formant synthesizer. One nice things
about the formant synthesizer is that it actually sounds a lot like an
analogue lead synth at times, while still retaining some of the
modulation richness of vocal formants. <br>

<br>

A brand new opcode for granular synthesis have been used in this
project. It is called &ldquo;partikkel&rdquo; and was written
for me by acoustics students Thom Johansen and Torgeir Strand
Henriksen. I got the idea for the opcode after reading Curtis
Roads&rsquo; &ldquo;Microsound&rdquo;. I wanted to have one
particle synthesizer capable of doing all variants of time based
granular synthesis. The reason for having it all in one opcode is that
it enables me to move gradually between different variants of the
technique. It has become one monster of an opcode, with approximately
50 input parameters (still not settled on a final parameter
configuration). It is not what you&rsquo;d call easy to use, but
the focus has been on maximum flexibility. One of the astonishing
features of the partikkel opcode is that it allows separate control per
grain over parameters like panning, effect sends, transposition, gain,
FM, etc. I&rsquo;ve written some mapping schemes for metaparameter
control, allowing the control of a multi-voice particle cloud with only
5 or 6 parameters. Here I&rsquo;m using metaparameters like
&ldquo;turbulence&rdquo;, &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;,
&ldquo;vertical size&rdquo;, &ldquo;duration&rdquo; and
&ldquo;width&rdquo; while playing back a precomposed automation
of some three-hundred-and-a-few separate parameters, allowing the
metaparameters to modulate the automation.<br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">SY: Wow! It is great to
hear&nbsp; that you have a really generic granular synthesis opcode
and it sounds like it is possible to get a really wide variety of sound
from it.&nbsp; Will you be publishing this opcode and mapping
schemes?</span><br>

<br>

(Smiles) Of course I will. There are two reasons why this
hasn&rsquo;t been done already. One is that I&rsquo;ve tried to
come up with a good input parameter configuration for the opcode, to
make it more accessible to other users. The other reason is that I need
assistance from the students that helped me build this opcode in the
first place, and it&rsquo;s been hard for them to allocate enough
time to the project now that they&rsquo;re finished studying. But I
keep pushing for this to happen sometime soon, and I also try to find
money to pay them for their time spent. I would also like to write some
examples or tutorials for the opcode to get other people started using
it.<br>

<br>

<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">SY: Now that
you&rsquo;ve finally finished this massive project, what are your
plans now for your own work?&nbsp; Do you have more Flyndre-sized
projects in mind?</span><br>

<br>

Well, there are actually a few more installation projects coming up.
One that I&rsquo;ve started working on is an installation for a
local college. They&rsquo;ve built a new central building for the
school, connecting existing buildings. I&rsquo;m working together
with the Norwegian artist Viel Bjerkeset Andersen on this project. We
will build several tree-like structures with aluminium tubes, relating
to the paths of movement of people within the connected buildings of
the school. For the audio part of the installation, I will be using the
acoustic characteristics of the tubes as a basis. I will put a speaker
in one end of such a tube, and a microphone in the other end, creating
a feedback loop that enhances the resonant frequencies of the tube. I
will write a Csound instrument that acts as a slow responding feedback
eliminator. Hopefully this will create a sort of didjeridoo-ish organic
ambient texture with evolving harmonic content. In addition I will use
the particle opcode to distribute particles of the drone sound onto
speakers mounted on the windows of some transit corridors connecting
the various buildings.<br>

<br>

But, my main focus when looking forward is to take the software used in
Flyndre and rework it for use in concerts. I would like to implement
more compositional techniques, and there are also the challenges
related to setting up intuitive ways of controlling a multi-parameter
application in realtime. I&rsquo;m using a very flexible hardware
controller, the Marimba Lumina. I hope to set up some mapping schemes
for it that allows the simultaneous control of composition algorithms
while also using it to play melodies as a traditional midi controller.<br>

<br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">SY: Thank you very much
&Oslash;yvind for sharing your thoughts and experiences with The
Flyndre and Csound.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad that you&rsquo;ve
taken the time out to discuss all of this and I am looking forward to
experiencing more of your work and learning more from you in the
future. Hopefully someday I&rsquo;ll have a chance to visit Norway
to experience this work live too!&nbsp; Thanks again!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<br style="font-weight: bold;">

&Oslash;B: You&rsquo;re welcome, and thanks for taking the time
to do the interview.</p>
