<p> With the Fall 2005 edition, Csound Journal has been launched
again
following the earlier work of Hans Mikelson and his Csound Magazine.
Csound Journal belongs to the community of Csounders, and hopefully
people will feel free to contribute on a regular basis. I have found
plenty of good inspiration in the Csound community, which seems to have
a unique personality from the other software synthesis groups. I am not
exactly sure what makes that unique quality, but nevertheless I
recognize it, and believe that Csounders have a strong sense of
community with many interesting voices. If I move away from csound
briefly and work with other synthesis engines, I find myself missing
the particular challenges Csound offers, and I miss the control that
csound affords over digital audio as well. I recall secretly using
Csound while at work one day, and one of the company's owners happened
to walk into the studio while a particularly wild sound was being
rendered. I was sure I was going to be fired. Instead he looked bemused
for a second, then said..."wow Jim, you have a future in making weird
sounds". I took that as compliment, and replied..."sorry, I just get
tired of sine waves after a while and I was just searching for
something a little different". I think Csound affords plenty of
opportunities for subjects to write about, ponder over, speculate about
future developments, and relate news and updates about goings on and
discoveries as well as modifications and improvements. Hopefully Csound
Journal will continue and be still another vehicle Csounders will use
regularly to help express all those different voices, opinions and
ideas.</p>

<p>When I had first come across Csound in the late 90's, one of
the
resources that greatly helped me out in learning and exploring this
wonderful tool was Hans Mikelson's Csound Magazine. &nbsp;I
remember&nbsp; always looking forward to new issues and
appreciating
very much the contributions of the authors as well as Hans' work on
producing such a fine online magazine. &nbsp;When the Csound
Magazine
ceased publishing, it seemed like a vital forum for sharing knowledge,
experiences, and ideas&nbsp;about music making with Csound had come
to
a close.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since then, Csound has grown tremendously as a music making
tool, a
product of many long hours of development time by generous developers
giving their free time to work to further the tool, as well as
thoughtful suggestions by the user community. &nbsp;The computing
power
of computers has also rapidly grown in that time, opening up many new
ways to look at and work with Csound.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has been very exciting working with Jim to put together
this
premiere issue of the Csound
Journal and I hope with it to continue the great tradition of the
Csound Magazine's high-quality articles aimed at teaching and exploring
the many facets of Csound and music making with it. &nbsp;I hope
you
will enjoy reading this issue, as well as consider contributing an
article yourself!&nbsp;</p>
