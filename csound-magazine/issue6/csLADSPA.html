	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>
	Csound
	is one of the most powerful audio programming languages available to
	electroacoustic composers today. It origins can be traced directly
	back to Max Matthews in Bell Labs and since its inception it has
	grown to become one of the most extensive computer music toolkits in
	development. This paper will describe a new toolkit for the
	development of LADSPA plugins using the Csound audio programming
	language. The toolkit itself was developed using the new Csound API
	and the Linux Audio Developers Simple Plugin API. This text will
	explore the implementation of said toolkit and conclude with 
	examples of the toolkit in use.

	<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
	<p>csLADSPA
	is a new toolkit for the development of LADSPA[1] plugins using the
	Csound audio programming language. csLADSPA provides musicians with
	no low-level programming experience with a simple albeit powerful
	toolkit for the development of audio plugins. The main goal of this
	project keeps in line with one of the main objectives of the LADSPA
	project i.e., to create a 'simple' architecture for the development
	of plugins. It was of the utmost importance to the author that the
	end-user need only a rudimentary knowledge of Csound in order to get
	started with csLADSPA. It is expected that a novice user will in
	time explore more of Csound to create complex plugins.</p>
	<H2 >1.1 The Csound host API</H2>
	<p>An API
	(application programming interface) is an interface provided by a
	computer system, library or application, which provides users with a
	way of accessing functions and routines particular to the control
	program. Essentially APIs provide developers with a means of
	harnessing an existing applications functionality within a host
	application.</p>

	<p>The
	Csound API[2] can be used to start any number of Csound instances
	through a series of different calling functions. The API also
	provides mechanisms for two way communication with an instance of
	Csound through the use of a 'named software bus'. In short, the
	Csound API makes it possible to harness all the power of Csound in
	ones own application.  
	</p>
	<H2 >1.2 LADSPA Plugins</H2>
	<p>The LADSPA framework came to
	fruition in early 2000 following the combined efforts of Paul Davis,
	Richard W.E. Furse, and Stefan Westerfield[3]. LADSPA provides
	developers with a simple way of developing audio plugins which can
	be loaded by a wide range of host applications. In terms of
	implementation, all LADSPA plugins must:</p>
	<p>
	 
	</p>
	<p>
	<BR>

	</p>
	<UL>
		<li>
		Declare a plugin structure (for audio buffers, etc.).</li>
		<li>
		Instantiate the plug-in by calling a user defined function which
		returns a LADSPA_Handle data type. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Register the plugin using a user-defined 'ladspa_descriptor()'
		function. 
		</li>

		<li>
		Connect ports to data locations using a user-defined connect
		function.  
		</li>
		<li>
		Process blocks of samples in a run function. 
		</li>
		<li>Free
		memory 
		</li>
	</UL>
	<h2>2 Inside
	csLADSPA</h2>

	<p>The csLADSPA
	library was written in C++[4]. It is programmed using the same basic
	structure as any LADSPA plugin. Calls are made to the Csound API at
	different stages in the execution of the plugin. The Plugin declares
	a data structure, which includes a pointer to an instance of the
	Csound class,  an array to hold control values and an array to hold
	the names of the software bus channels which will be used for
	parameter control. The steps taken in the actual operation of the
	plugin are as follows: 
	</p>
	<UL>
		<li>
		When the plugin is loaded, all Csound (.csd) files which reside in
		the plugin folder are parsed. This data is assigned to the various
		members of the LADSPA descriptor structure. This step generates a
		series of plugins based on the Csound source code files created by
		user. 
		</li>
		<li>
		When a plugin is
		instantiated, csLADSPA creates a Csound instance and compiles the
		respective Csound source code. 
		</li>

		<li>
		This is followed by the connection of ports to data locations and
		the assignment of control values to an array of floats. This can be
		assessed from inside the run function, which is called by the host
		application. 
		</li>
		<li>
		When the host runs the plugin, blocks of samples are processed in a
		‘run’ function. This accesses the Csound instance low-level IO
		buffers, through  calls to Csound::Spin() and Csound::Spout(), in
		order to route the selected audio to it. Finally, inside a
		processing loop a call is made to Csound::PerformKsmps(), which
		does the actual signal processing.</li>
		<p>
		</p>
	</UL>
	<p>A basic model
	of how the plugins work is shown in below  (fig.1). The host
	application loads the csLADSPA plugin. When the user hits the
	process button the csLADSPA library will route the selected audio to
	an instance of Csound. Csound will then process this audio and
	return it to the csLADSPA plugin which will then pass that audio to
	the host application.</p>

	<H2 >2.1 Getting started</H2>
	<p>In order to
	get started writing csLADSPA plugins the end-user must place the
	csLADSPA library and all csd plugin files in the folder pointed to
	by the LADSPA_PATH environment variable. LADSPA_PATH must be set in
	order for csLADSPA library to work. The csLADSPA library will
	automatically detect all Csound files and load them as separate
	plugins. In order to keep things simple, csLADSPA only works with
	the unified Csound file format. 
	</p>

        <I>Figure 1. The csLADSPA model</I></p>

	
	<H2 >2.2 csLADSPA tags</H2>
	<p> In order for
	csLADSPA to load the Csound files in the LADSPA_PATH the user must
	specify some basic information about the plugin. This is done by
	adding a section at the top of the Csound file whereby the user can
	specify things like the name of the plugin, the author, etc. It is
	in this section that the user can also specify the control ports
	they will need in order to interact with their Csound code when
	running the plugin through a host. Every csLADSPA plugin must
	specify the following:</p>

	<TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR="#000000" CELLPADDING=7 CELLSPACING=1>

	<p>If users wish to add controls to
	their plugins they can do so using the following tags:</p>

	<TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR="#000000" CELLPADDING=7 CELLSPACING=1>

				<p>ControlPort</p>
			</TD>
			<TD>
				<p>
				The name of the control as it appears when the plugin is ran and
				the name of the channel which Csound will retrieve the data on.
				The two names should be separated by a '|' symbol.  
				</p>
			</TD>
		</TR>
		<TR VALIGN=TOP>

			<TD>

				<p>Plugin
				max/min range. Again the two values are separated by a '|'
				symbol. If users wish to controls to respond logarithmically they
				can add a '&amp;log' after they specify the range values.  
				</p>
			</TD>
		</TR>

	</TABLE>

	<p>Note that if a user uses the
	ControlPort tag they must
	<I>always</I> place a Range
	tag underneath it. Examples of how these tags are used can be seen
	in the next section.</p>

	<h2>3 Examples</h2>
	<p>
	In the following section three csLADSPA plugins will be presented.
	The first two plugins will illustrate the mechanisms for
	communication between the host and the csLADSPA plugin. The third
	and final plugin will illustrate a more complex process which makes
	use of some of the more advanced opcodes included with Csound5,
	i.e., the PVS[5] opcodes. 
	</p>

	<H2 >3.1 A basic gain plugin</H2>

	<p>
	  Given that most plugin SDKs come with a simple 'gain' example
	we'll start here too. Here is the full code to a simple gain
	example.</p>
	
	<pre>
&lt;csLADSPA&gt;
Name=Gain Plugin
Maker=John Doe
UniqueID=1049
Copyright=None
ControlPort=Gain|gain
Range=0|2
&lt;/csLADSPA&gt;

&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;

&lt;CsInstruments&gt;
sr = 44100
ksmps = 10
nchnls = 1

instr 1

kGain   chnget &quot;gain&quot;

ain 	in
	
        out	ain*kGain 
endin

&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;

&lt;CsScore&gt;
	
i1 0 3600

&lt;/CsScore&gt;
	
&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;

</pre>

	<p>
	As previously mentioned the means of communication between the
	plugin and the instance of Csound is provided by the named software
	bus, in this case the name given to the software channel is 'gain'.
	In Csound we can use the chnget
	opcode to retrieve data from a particular software bus. In
	the case above this data is used to multiply the output signal by a
	value between  0 and 2, as defined by the Range

	tag in the &lt;csLADSPA&gt;
	section of the above code.</p>

	<H2 >3.2 A simple flanging plugin</H2>
	<p>Flanging is a
	commonly used digital audio effect. It's created by mixing a signal
	with a time-varying delayed version of itself. In Csound this can be
	done by using the vdelay opcode. To control the amount of delay one
	can use a low frequency oscillator or LFO. This plugin will need two
	control ports, one for the flange depth and one for the flange rate.
	Here is the full code for a simple 'flanger' plugin.</p>

	<pre>
&lt;csLADSPA&gt;
Name=Flanger
Maker=John Doe
UniqueID=1054
Copyright=None
ControlPort=Flange Depth|depth
Range=0|1
ControlPort=Flange Rate|rate
Range=0|10
&lt;/csLADSPA&gt;
	

&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
	
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;
	
sr = 44100
ksmps = 10
nchnls = 1

instr 1

            out ar+ain

endin
	
&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;
	
&lt;CsScore&gt;
	
f1 0 1024 10 1
i1 0 3600
	
&lt;/CsScore&gt;

&lt;/CsoundSynthesizer&gt;	 
	</pre>
	<H2 >3.3 A spectral manipulation plugin</H2>
	<p>Csound5 comes
	with a host of new Phase Vocoder Streaming, PVS, opcodes. These
	opcodes provide users with a means of manipulating spectral
	components of a signal in realtime. In the following example the
	opcodes pvsanal, pvsblur
	and pvsynth are used to
	manipulate the spectrum of the selected audio. The plugin averages
	the amp/freq time functions of each analysis channel for a specified
	time.</p>
    
    <pre>
&lt;csLADSPA&gt;
Name=PVSBlur
Maker=John Doe
UniqueID=1056
Copyright=None
ControlPort=Max Delay|del
Range=0|1
ControlPort=Blur Time|blur
Range=0|10 &amp;log
&lt;/csLADSPA&gt;

&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;
&lt;CsInstruments&gt;
sr = 44100
ksmps = 10
nchnls = 1

instr 1

	<h2>4 Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
	The current version of csLADSPA performs adequately and has been
	tested by students in the National University of Ireland Maynooth
	and at Dundalk Institute of Technology, Ireland. The system has been
	used both as a creative tool and as a pedagogical utility used in
	the teaching of DSP techniques. It has been fully tested in
	real-time using Jack-Rack[6] and in non-realtime mode using
	Audacity[7]. With regards to
	future developments the authors are currently working on a better 
	error-checking system and multichannel support is also being
	investigated.
