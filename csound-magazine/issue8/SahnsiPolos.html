<h2>Introduction</h2>

This article describes a project to sample, analyze, and create a
composition of computer music simulating the gamelan instruments
Kemong, Kempli, Jegogan, Gong, Calung, Gangsa, and Reyong. Central to
the project was analyzing pitch frequencies, and simulating the
harmonic beating which takes place between the Sahnsi and Polos of
several instruments. The procedure for sampling the instruments, and
also utilizing a software synthesis application to analyze the sounds
will be described below. A composition by Akito Van Troyer employing
additive synthesis techniques was created, and details of the
composition implementation including novel procedures for employing
table look-up functions to control rhythm, tempo, and duration will be
explained.&nbsp;

I. Sampling and Analysis<br>

</h2>

<h3>Gamelan Instrument Samples </h3>

In order to analyze pitch frequencies of the gamelan instruments
employed for the project, and to determine the rate of harmonic beating
between paired instruments, recordings were made and samples were
collected. The recording procedure included the use of two microphones
for source stereo recording, at 96KHz, 16 bit. Later the sample files
were downsampled to 44.1KHz, 16bit for analysis purposes. Each
instrument was struck and allowed to sustain for the duration of the
recording. Instruments were recorded separately (Sahnsi or Polos),
together (Sahnsi and Polos), and in stereo and mono.

<h3>Analysis</h3>

The purpose of sampling the instruments was to discover the actual
pitches as frequencies as well as the frequency of harmonic beating
between the paired instruments. While tuning and pitch scales of
gamelan instruments fall within traditional patterns, Christine
Southworth has noted that the beating rates vary, both within each
gamelan and between different gamelans(SOUTHWORTH). In addition,
tunings of the various Indonesian gamelans generally differ in both
starting frequencies and subsequent intervals (SOUTHWORTH). <br>

<br>

After sampling the instruments, the attack caused by striking the
instrument was removed using an audio editor, resulting in a sample
which was the sustain portion of the sound minus the attack transient.
It was noted earlier the source 96KHz samples were downsampled to
44.1KHz for purposes of analysis. <br>

<br>

Frequency analysis was performed employing the external MaxMSP<sup>1</sup>
fiddle~ object (Puckette, 1998: MSP port by Ted Apel, David Zicarelli)
in a patch created by Akito Van Troyer. The fiddle~ object, a pitch
estimator and sinusoidal peak finder, can be employed to report
frequencies for partials.
<br>

<br>

Figure2 shows a Gangsa sample being analyzed in real-time. Pitch is
accumulated using midi pitch numbers, then the midi number is converted
to frequency in hertz using the mtof object. The fiddle~ reported midi
pitch numbers are shown in the Max window on the right side of the
image, while the frequency in hertz is reported in the large number box
near the left center of the image.
<br>

<div align="center">Figure2. Van Troyer's Max/MSP patch to
analyze gamelan samples.</div>

<br>

The fiddle~ object can also be used to verify rates for harmonic
beating. The rate of harmonic beating can be deduced as the result of
the difference between two closely related frequencies which cause the
beating. Figure3 shows adapting a "cooked" output of fiddle~ to verify
beat frequencies using the Max objects counter and clocker. <br>

Appendix I shows the complete list of pitch frequencies analyzed, as
well the beat rates observed, for both Sahnsi and Polos of the gamelan
instruments.

<h2>II. Composition <br>

</h2>

The spectral analysis data of gamelan instruments showed that additive
synthesis could be employed to simulate the basic sound of the
instruments. Additive synthesis was employed using Csound by summing
instances of the oscili opcode (see below). Partial content was
heightened by adjusting partials and amplitudes as a creative component
in the piece. The heightened partial content was selected, utilizing
Max/MSP filters prior to analysis by fiddle~ in the patch from Fig.2
above, in order to resonate particular frequencies<sup>2</sup>.
Partial frequencies reported by fiddle~ were converted to ratios and
placed in Csound ftables (indicated by -2, below). Gen2 transfers data
from immediate pfields into a function table. The partial ratios below
(1, 2.7, 4.63, etc.) do not represent a synthesized waveform, but
simply a list of numbers as ratios (for a complete view of the Csound
unified file see the attached Gamelan_Study1.csd in <a href="VanTroyerExs.zip">VanTroyerExs.zip</a> ). <br>

<br>

The use of the opcode oscili allows for changing and summing the
various partial numbers at the k-rate, which is shown below as the
input k-rate variable 'kpit'. The variable kpit is reading from zack
space location 12. Code not shown was used to convert the ratio numbers
back to cycles per second before writing to zack space (see the
Gamelan_Study1.csd file in <a href="VanTroyerExs.zip">VanTroyerExs.zip</a>
).

<br>

Beat frequencies between Sahnsi and Polos were created using a second
Csound instrument, similar to the first, but having a slight pitch
offset. The k-rate variable 'kbet' (below) shows the addition of a six
hertz offset.
<pre>kpit zkr 12<br>ktimb zkr 1<br>kbet = 6<br>a1 oscili klp, kpit+abet, iosc ; fundamental<br>a2 oscili klp*ks2, ((kpit*kp2)*ktimb)+kbet,iosc ; first harmonic<br>a3 oscili klp*ks3, ((kpit*kp3)*ktimb)+kbet, iosc ; second<br>a4 oscili klp*ks4, ((kpit*kp4)*ktimb)+kbet, iosc<br>a5 oscili klp*ks5, ((kpit*kp5)*ktimb)+kbet, iosc<br>a6 oscili klp*ks6, ((kpit*kp6)*ktimb)+kbet, iosc<br></pre>

<div align="center">Csound code excerpt from instr 5;
Jegogan.</div>

<br>

Considerable effort was spent on algorithmic design to ensure that
Csound's score file entries were kept to a minimum<sup>3</sup>.
Since Csound receives events from the score which include start time,
and duration; note lengths or durations are normally part of the score.
<br>

<br>

In Van Troyer's design, however, rhythms are generated as samples
employing ftables. Table 162, for example, which contains zeros and
ones, is read by a phasor. When the phasor encounters a '1', a note is
triggered. The speed of the phasor and the number of zeros between the
ones determines a micro-rhythm which is repeated as one of the basic
rhythmic cells during a formal section of the piece<sup>4</sup>.
<br>

<br>

<font face="courier new" size="2">gitmap162 ftgen
162, 0, 32, -2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0,
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0</font>
<br>

<br>

The duration of formal sections, in which different instruments are
sounding, or changing tempos, or amplitude over the duration of that
section is determined by a hierarchical system of sequencing ftables<sup>5</sup>.
In other words, ftables call ftables, which contain values. Hence the
large number of ftables utilized in the composition. Global control of
the tempo of the formal sections of the piece is determined by the
linseg opcode which sends terraced envelope step values to instruments
which also contain phasors. The speed of the phasors in several
instruments, each representing a different gamelan instrument, is
controlled globally in that manner. Dynamics are also controlled
globally through a k-rate value used as the amplitude input values for
the oscili opcodes<sup>6</sup>.
<br>

<br>

Although the piece is possible to render in real-time in Csound by
adjusting various header parameters (see "Csound Users Manual", "Using
Csound, Optimizing Audio I/O Latency"), due to the heavy demands on the
processor, the piece has been rendered to an mp3 for listening<sup>7</sup>
(see attached Gamelan_Study1.mp3 in <a href="VanTroyerExs.zip">VanTroyerExs.zip</a>
).
<h2>III. Conclusion <br>

</h2>

Csound is an effective software synthesis application for employing
additive synthesis techniques to simulate the sound of gamelan
instruments. In one sense, the Balinese Gamelan can be thought of as a
sort of large, additive synthesis instrument. The shimmering quality of
the tones produced by the harmonic beating effect due to slight
differences in tunings between instruments is easy to reproduce, but
may have further reaching implications in sympathetic resonances (for
example with gamelan gongs) which were not investigated in this
project.

[2] LowPass or HighPass filters were applied to the gamelan instruments
samples before the fiddle~ analysis, creating an equalization effect in
order to increase the amplitudes of certain partials. The image below
shows Van Troyer's Max/MSP analysis patch employing filters as pre-EQ.

[3] Several instruments act as triggering instruments for other
instruments. For example instrument 20 Kempli (the metronome-like
instrument), triggers instrument 1 using the schedkwhen opcode. This
method is employed to help control overall entrances of particular
instruments without having to list too many events in the score. At
other places in the code the event opcode is used to trigger score
events, such as instrument 25 Jegogan Trigger, which allows instruments
4 and 5 to play.

[4] The ktab variable in instrument 29 Gangsa Trigger, represents
values from table 162. Further kpp = ktrig*ktab, such that later if
(kpp == 1) then instrument 8 Gangsa Polos is triggered by schedkwhen. <br>

[5] A small graphic portion of the formal design below shows table 500
which calls tables 600, 601, 602, 603, etc. Table 600 in turn calls
tables 67, 68, 69, 70 etc. In each of those tables, for ex. table 67
individual pitch frequencies 448, 448, 828 etc. are indicated.

[6] Instruments 100 and 101 write k-rate values from a linseg opcode to
zack space and are used for global tempo and dynamic control. In
several instruments the linseg k-rate values are read from zack space
into a ktemp variable which is used for local tempo control. Many
instruments also read from zack space into a kdyn variable which is
applied to the oscili amplitude parameter for overall dynamics control.
Instrument 101 also uses the loopseg opcode to control the dynamics of
instruments 8 and 9, Gangsa, and Reyong by writing a kvalue, kdyn to
zack space. Instruments 10 and 11, also Gangsa and Reyong employ kdyn =
(kdyn*(1-2))+1 to invert the kdyn value read from zack space. Thus the
amplitude of instrs 10 and 11 work in opposite amplitudes from instr 8
and 9, as Gangsa and Reyong alternate as voices during the performance
of the piece.

[7] Beyond adjusting the parameters specified in "Optimizing Audio I/O
Latency" from the "Csound Users Manual", such as number of ksmps, the
software(-b) and hardware buffer(-B), and the user's preferred rtaudio
module (alsa, portaudio, MME, etc.); an additional setting which is the
kval number assigned as input to the vdelayk opcode may also require
adjustment for real-time performance. The vdelayk opcode appears in
instruments 29, 31, 33, and 35 Gangsa and Reyong and adds a small
amount of delay for the specified instruments in the phasor start time
in order to synchronize other instruments with the Kempli instrument
which is the beat keeper (sounds like a metronome). <br>

[8] Chapter 2, "Representing Music", discusses spectra, interval
ratios, partials and overtones, dynamic spectra, bandwidth etc. which
are basic topics applicable to computer music.
