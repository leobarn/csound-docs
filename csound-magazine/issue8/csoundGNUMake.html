Introduction
<br>

</h2>



<p>
Composing with Csound involves rendering Csound orchestra and score
files, converting sound files from WAV or AIFF to MP3, generating
scores from pre-processors such as SCORE-11 and CMask, generating
analysis files with tools like pvanal and hetro, and so on. Doing all
these tasks by hand is tedious and error-prone. A build system is a
tool designed for this kind of task&mdash;it tracks dependencies in a
project and performs actions needed to successfully build the final
product. For example, figure 1 shows the
dependencies of a hypothetical Csound composition. The yellow boxes
represent things that are automatically generated from other files.

<p>
The final composition, <tt>foo.wav</tt>, depends on <tt>foo.orc</tt> and
<tt>foo.sco</tt>, which is generated from <tt>foo.cmask</tt>. The file
<tt>foo.orc</tt> uses the pvoc file <tt>flute.pvx</tt>, which has to be
generated from <tt>flute.wav</tt>. Finally, we want to generate an Ogg Vorbis file to post the composition on the Internet. These are the
necessary commands to render this project:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>pvanal flute.wav flute.pvx<br>cmask foo.cmask &gt; foo.sco<br>csound -o foo.wav foo.orc foo.sco<br>oggenc -q 8 foo.wav<br></pre>



<p>
We don't want to execute these four commands every time we'll render
the composition. For example, it is not necessary to run <tt>pvanal</tt>
again if we change only the score. On the other hand, if we change
<tt>foo.cmask</tt> we have to run <tt>CMask</tt> and <tt>Csound</tt> again
(lines 2-4) but not <tt>pvanal</tt> (line 1). In this paper we will see
how to use a build system to automate tasks like these. We will use GNU
Make 
[5], but there are other build systems such as
Scons 
[3], Rake 
[7], and Ant
[2].

<h2>
<br>


I. Building things with Make
<br>

</h2>



<p>
The rules do build a computer program, a L<sup><small>A</small></sup>T<small>E</small>X document, or a Csound composition are defined in a file called Makefile. In this file
we define rules with the following syntax:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>target: dependencies<br>    actions<br></pre>

<p>The indentation before each action has to be done with a tab and not spaces, otherwise Make will complain.</p>

<p>
A <i>target</i> usually is a file to build, <i>dependencies</i> are
files or other targets that the current target needs, and
<i>actions</i> are the commands that have to be issued to build the
target. To build a WAV file using Csound we define the following rule:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>foo.wav: foo.orc foo.sco<br>    csound -o foo.wav foo.orc foo.sco<br></pre>



<p>
The file <tt>foo.wav</tt> is the target we want to build, foo.orc and
foo.sco are the files needed to build <tt>foo.wav</tt>, and the second
line is the action needed to build <tt>foo.wav</tt>. If one of them is
missing, make will try to build them or report an error. A rule to
build an Ogg Vorbis file from our generated WAV file is as follows:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>foo.ogg: foo.wav<br>    oggenc -q 8 foo.wav<br></pre>



<p>
Now let's consider how these two rules would interact with each other.
If <tt>foo.wav</tt> already exists, make will apply the rule
<tt>foo.ogg</tt> directly, without trying to regenerate <tt>foo.wav</tt>.
However, if make detects that <tt>foo.orc</tt> (a dependency of
<tt>foo.wav</tt>) has changed, it will rebuild <tt>foo.wav</tt> before
building <tt>foo.ogg</tt>. That's the nice thing about build systems;
they build only what is necessary. Having these rules in the Makefile,
we can ask make to build a specific rule with commands like
&ldquo;<tt>make foo.wav</tt>'' and &rdquo;<tt>make foo.ogg</tt>''.

</p>

<p>
If we want to build different targets of the same type (like three
different Ogg Vorbis files from three different WAV files) we use what is
called &ldquo;implicit rules''. It defines a general rule for building a
specific kind of target. For example, the implicit rule for generating
pvoc files is:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>%.pvx: %.wav<br>    pvanal $&lt; $@<br></pre>



<p>
This rule depends on a WAV file and runs the pvanal utility to
generate a pvoc file with the <tt>.pvx</tt> extension. The &ldquo;%'' symbol
is used to define a pattern. The pattern %.wav means any file with
the extension <tt>.wav</tt>, for example. The symbol $&lt; matches the
name of the dependency and $@ the name of the target.

</p>

<p>
Implicit rules allow us to define more concise and general rules. The
implicit rule to generate a pvoc file will work with any pvoc file
with a <tt>.pvx</tt> extension, while a specific rule will only work for
a specific file:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>foo.pvx: foo.wav<br>    pvanal foo.wav foo.pvx<br></pre>



<p>
Having defined an implicit rule, we need to define only the target and
dependencies:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>foo.pvx: foo.wav<br><br>bar.pvx: bar.wav<br><br>flute.pvx: flute.wav<br></pre>



<p>
Following is a rule for generating Csound scores from CMask files.
Again, $@ is used to match the score file (the target) and $&lt; to
match the CMask file (the dependency).

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>%.sco: %.cmask<br>    cmask $&lt; &gt; $@<br></pre>



<p>
We can define a rule to generate Ogg Vorbis files in the same way, except
that, since the program <tt>oggenc</tt> generates Ogg Vorbis files with the
same name of the input file automatically, we don't need to use $@.

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>%.ogg: %.wav<br>    oggenc -q 8 $&lt;<br></pre>



<p>
To define a rule to render an .orc and .sco using Csound. We use $@ as
before to match the target name (the WAV file on this case) and $&lt; to
match the dependencies. The symbol $&lt; actually matches all
dependencies; in this case the orchestra and score file names.

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>%.wav: %.orc %.sco<br>    csound -o $@ $&lt;<br></pre>



<p>

</p>

<h2>
<br>


II. Working with sections
<br>

</h2>



<p>
Csound has support to divide a composition into sections using the
<tt>s</tt> statement in the score. However, it doesn't allow the
rendering of a specific section. Csound will render the whole
composition even if only one or two sections have changed. This
behavior is undesired for a large and complex composition, were the
rendering time can be high. We want a way to render only the sections
that the composer changed since the last rendering. 

</p>

<p>Some composers generate sound files using Csound and assemble them
in
a graphical sound editor or digital audio workstation such as Pro Tools
or Ardour. A command line mixer can be used for this same
purpose with the advantage that if we change the composition (that is,
the Csound files), the final mixdown will be regenerated
automatically. In a graphical tool we would have to reassemble
manually the music each time a change happens. There are many command
line tools to mix sound files together. For simple uses the
<tt>mixer</tt> Csound utility is good enough.

</p>

<p>
Suppose we have 3 sections, <i>a</i>, <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>c</tt>,
with duration of 10, 15, and 17 seconds, respectively. Section
<tt>a</tt> starts at time 0, section <tt>b</tt> at time 10, and
section <tt>c</tt> at 20 seconds, as shown in figure
2.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<div>
<table align="center">


  <caption align="bottom"><strong>Figure 2:</strong>
Three sections</caption>
  <tbody>

    <tr>

      <td>
      
      <div>  <img src="images/sections.png" alt="Image sections" align="bottom" border="0">
  </div>

      </td>

    </tr>


  
  </tbody>
</table>


</div>



<p>
The command to mix them with <tt>mixer</tt> is

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>mixer -T 0 a.wav -T 10 b.wav -T 20 c.wav -o final.wav<br></pre>



<p>
It is not necessary to include the durations of files&mdash;only where
they begin. The <tt>-T</tt> flag defines the beginning time and <tt>-o</tt>
the output file. <tt>Mixer</tt> has more options, like the <tt>-F</tt> flag
to change the volume of a file. The following command will mix the files again, but this time <tt>c.wav</tt> will be twice as loud.

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>mixer -T 0 a.wav -T 10 b.wav -F 2 -T 20 c.wav -o final.wav<br></pre>



<p>
If <tt>a.wav</tt>, <tt>b.wav</tt>, and <tt>c.wav</tt> are generated by Csound, we can define the following rules to render the sections
individually and mix them together:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>a.wav: a.orc a.sco<br>b.wav: b.orc b.sco<br>c.wav: c.orc c.sco<br><br>final.wav: a.wav b.wav c.wav<br>    mixer -T 0 a.wav -T 10 b.wav -F 2 -T 20 c.wav -o final.wav<br></pre>



<p>
Make will only generate <tt>final.wav</tt> if it doesn't exist or
<tt>a.wav</tt>, <tt>b.wav</tt>, or <tt>c.wav</tt> haven't changed. As
stated before, if all WAV files are created and we change only one
file, <tt>a.sco</tt> for example, only <tt>a.wav</tt> and <tt>final.wav</tt>
will be generated again.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2>
<br>


III. Advanced usage
<br>

</h2>



<p>
We can use Csound's environment variables to organize our composition.
The following example defines and exports SFDIR, SSDIR, and SADIR:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>export SFDIR = /home/kroger/csound/sfdir/<br>export SSDIR = /home/kroger/csound/ssdir/<br>export SADIR = /home/kroger/csound/sadir/<br></pre>



<p>
We may want to use the <tt>vpath</tt> feature as well. It defines the
default path for specific types of files. Using <tt>vpath</tt> we
don't have to specify where a file has to be read or written. &nbsp;Make
will do it automatically:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>vpath %.aif $(SSDIR)<br>vpath %.aiff $(SSDIR)<br>vpath %.wav $(SSDIR)<br>vpath %.wav $(SFDIR)<br>vpath %.pvx $(SADIR)<br>vpath %.con $(SADIR)<br>vpath %.het $(SADIR)<br>vpath %.lpc $(SADIR)<br></pre>



<p>
In these two previous examples, SFDIR, SSDIR, and SADIR are defined as
variables. Variables can be defined with the form <tt>variable =
  value</tt> and called with <tt>$(variable)</tt>.

</p>

<p>
If we work with sections, we will want to render all score files in a
composition. One way to do it is to simply list all resulting WAV
files as dependencies:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>all: a.wav b.wav c.wav<br></pre>



<p>
When we issue &ldquo;<tt>make all</tt>'', make will build all dependencies
for &ldquo;all'' automatically (if we have defined an implicit rule for WAV
files). We can automatize this one step further by asking make to
construct the dependency list for us. The command <tt>$(wildcard
  *.sco)</tt> will return a list with all score files in the current
directory. In our example it would return <tt>a.sco</tt>,
<tt>b.sco</tt>, and <tt>c.sco</tt>. Now we want to substitute the
<tt>.sco</tt> suffix to <tt>.wav</tt>. This substitution can be
accomplished by the <tt>subst</tt> command. It accepts three
arguments; the pattern that will be replaced (<tt>.sco</tt> in our
case), with the new pattern (<tt>.wav</tt> in our example), and a list of
the strings to modify (a list with file names in our case). The
complete command is:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>wavfiles = $(subst .sco,.wav,$(wildcard *.sco))<br></pre>



<p>
Now the variable <tt>wavfiles</tt> has a list of all WAV files that
can be generated form our score files. The definition of the &ldquo;all''
target them becomes:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>all: $(wavfiles)<br></pre>



<p>
Cleaning files, that is, removing automatically generated files, is as
important as creating them. In the same way we defined a list of WAV
files to build, we can use that list to define the files to be
removed. If the WAV files are generated in the current directory,
cleaning all generated files is as simples as <tt>rm
  $(wavfiles)</tt>. However, if they are being generated in a specific
directory, we have do append the directory do each file in the list.
The function <tt>addprefix</tt> can be used for this task. It accepts
two arguments, a prefix to append and a list of strings. The prefix
will be appended to each element of the list. The variable
<tt>fullwavfiles</tt> will hold the list of WAV files:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>fullwavfiles = $(addprefix $(SFDIR),$(wavfiles))<br></pre>



<p>
And the rule <tt>clean</tt> can be defined as:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>clean:<br>    rm -f $(fullwavfiles)<br></pre>



<p>
In section 1 we defined the following implicit rule to
generate WAV files using Csound:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>%.wav: %.orc %.sco<br>    csound -o $@ $&lt;<br></pre>



<p>
With it we can define rules such as

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>foo.wav: foo.orc foo.sco<br></pre>



<p>
But often a target will have more dependencies. In the following
example <tt>flute.pvx</tt> is also a dependency of <tt>foo.wav</tt> and
make will make sure it is built before <tt>foo.wav</tt>:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>foo.wav: foo.orc foo.sco flute.pvx<br><br>flute.pvx: flute.wav<br></pre>



<p>
The problem is that by using $&lt; in the implicit rule, make will match
all items in the dependency list. Using the command <tt>wordlist</tt>
we can select only the two first elements of the dependency list (that
is, the orchestra and score files):

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>%.wav: %.orc %.sco<br>    csound -g -o $@ $(wordlist 1, 2, $^)<br></pre>



<p>If we are building many files at once we may want to see only if the
file has been built successfully or not, and not see all messages
Csound and make produce. That would be the output, which shows the file
name and if there were any errors in performance:
</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>foo.wav:     0 errors in performance<br>bar.wav:     1 errors in performance<br>bla.wav:     0 errors in performance<br></pre>



<p>
The rule to implement it is as follows. The command <tt>2&gt;&amp;1</tt>
redirects the standard error (stderr) to the standard output
(stdout) 
[4] and <tt>grep "errors in
  performance"</tt> matches any message Csound gives about errors. The
character <tt>@</tt> in front of commands like <tt>csound</tt> and
<tt>echo</tt> tells make not to print the command when executing the
rule. 

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>%.wav: %.orc %.sco<br>ifeq ($(verbose),0)<br>    @echo -ne "$@:\t"<br>    @csound -g -o $@ $(wordlist 1, 2, $^) 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep "errors in performance"<br>else    <br>    @csound -g -o $@ $(wordlist 1, 2, $^)<br>endif<br></pre>



<p>
If the variable <tt>verbose</tt> is different from 0, make will execute Csound as usual, with all error messages. We can change the value of
the variable input while executing a make command:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>make foo.wav verbose=1<br></pre>



<p>

</p>

IV. Playing your work
<br>

</h2>



<p>
SoX 
[1] is a command line program that can convert to
and from many sound formats, apply effects, and record and play
sounds. Often while composing, it is necessary to listen to a passage
over and over until we are satisfied with it. We can use a graphical
sound player or editor, but it is much more productive to use a
command line player to &ldquo;debug'' a specific passage. The command
<tt>play foo.wav</tt> will play the file <tt>foo.wav</tt> from beginning
to end. The option <tt>trim</tt> can be used to play only a passage. For
example, the following command

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>play foo.wav trim 1:00 30<br></pre>



<p>
will start playing not from the beginning of the file, but after 1
second. The option 30 means that the file will be played for 30
seconds. Maybe we want to listen only to a channel from a passage, to
isolate some problem. The following command

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>play foo.wav -c 1 mixer -l<br></pre>



<p>
will play only the left channel, for example. The option <tt>-r</tt>
would play only the right channel. Sometimes we want to listen to a
passage more than one time. The option <tt>repeat</tt> can be used. For
instance, the following command will play the right channel of
<tt>foo.wav</tt> for 15 seconds, starting two seconds from the
beginning, and repeating it 3 times:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>play foo.wav -c 1 mixer -r trim 2:00 15 repeat 3<br></pre>



<p>
Finally, SoX can be useful to make quick conversions. For example, we
may want to quickly generate a stereo version of a quadraphonic
composition:

</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre>sox quad.wav -c 2 stereo.wav mixer 1,1<br></pre>



<p>
We can define rules in the Makefile to play or convert files
automatically. See section 5 for examples.

</p>

VI. Conclusion
<br>

</h2>



<p>
This paper presented a way to make the generation of Csound
compositions automatic with GNU Make. By using command line tools,
many Csound-related tasks can be automated with make. Make has many
other options and features that can be found in the excellent manual
[5]. Ecasound 
[6] is a very
powerful and flexible command line multitrack audio processing tool.
It can be used in place of Csound <tt>mixer</tt> for more sophisticated
uses.
