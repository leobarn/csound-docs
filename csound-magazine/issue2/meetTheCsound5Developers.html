<p>The creation of Csound 5 was a three-year-long project that was only 
accomplished by the collaborative efforts of many individuals from around 
the world.  Perhaps you have wondered who these people are, where they
live, and what they enjoy doing other than working on Csound in their spare time?</p>

<p>Below are the personal profiles of everyone  who 
directly worked on making Csound 5 a reality. You can read (in their own words)
about where they were born and grew up, how they use Csound and how they 
contributed to Csound 5, what their hobbies are, etc.  You can even get a glimpse
of what the future of Csound may look like by reading their &quot;vision statements.&quot;</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page is a list of many of the individuals who 
indirectly contributed to Csound 5 development by writing opcodes and discussing 
its design.  These people are responsible for many of the cool new toys that are
now available!</p>

<p>Finally, while I could not compile a complete list of everyone who helped,
we want to thank those members of the Csound community who contributed a lot of their 
time by testing and providing feedback before Csound 5 was finished.</p>

<p>Not sure -- perhaps forcing a release?  I think OSC is important.</p>

<p>[<i>Editor's note:</i> John is being modest here.  John provided organization and
direction for the project including setting up the Sourceforge site.  He moved many of the
opcodes from Csound 4 into separate loadable modules.  John revised Csound's audio file
reading/writing code and real-time code to use the libsndfile, PortAudio, and PortMidi libraries.
He also did a fair amount of work paving the way for multiple-instantiation and reentrancy in the
Csound library.  John added commandline options for new file formats and for setting orchestra
and score macros.  A new &quot;software bus&quot; for communications between hosts and Csound was designed
and implemented by John.  He wrote opcodes for the software bus, OSC, and a few others.  He 
worked with Erik de Castro Lopo to get looping support into libsndfile.  He provided support for
#ifdef in orchestra code and for dynamically loaded GEN routines.  John wrote an installer for
Linux systems and provides pre-compiled Linux packages for both 32-bit and 64-bit CPUs.
Finally, John did major work on writing a new orchestra parser for Csound that will be 
incorporated once it is finished.]</p>

I have contributed the Csound 5 SCons build system, the first version of the plugin
opcode system, the Csound API (the C, C++, Python, Java, Lua, and LISP interfaces 
are all by me with much help from others, and there is now also a Tcl interface by 
Victor Lazzarini), the CsoundVST plugin and front end, the Mixer opcodes, the MIDI 
interop opcodes, the STK C++ opcodes, the Windows installers, and the Silence system 
of algorithmic composition classes based on music graphs in the CsoundVST library. 
I also maintain the Loris opcodes in Csound 5. I helped Andres Cabrera develop his 
vst4cs opcodes. I wrote a first version of the fluid SoundFont opcodes, which has 
been replaced by an improved version by Steven Yi. I also contributed two chapters 
(on the CD-ROM) to Richard Boulanger's &quot;The Csound Book&quot;.

<h4>Vision for Csound:</h4>
 </td>
 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
<p>My vision for the future of Csound is: everyone will standardize on version 5,
Csound 5 will become a normal part of Linux distributions, people will begin
distributing plugin opcodes independently of Csound, someone will develop a set
of GigaSampler opcodes, someone will develop a clustering system for Csound
using the API that will enable massive speedups in offline rendering, people
will settle on a standard set of pfields to enable the exchange of instrument
definitions, someone will implement OSC on Windows, someone will do a Rewire
interface for Csound using the API... in general, I hope and expect that Csound
will become integrated into more and more studio environments, and be used not
just by computer music specialists but by film composers, commercial producers,
and others.</p>

<p>In the long run I would like to see one well-known PROGRAMMABLE software
synthesizer with the same kind of power as Csound become a standard part of
commercial notation and sequencing software, either as a plugin or as a
builtin. I do not really care if it is Csound, SuperCollider, or something new.
But it needs to be both flexible and standard so that the language becomes, in
essence, a new form of music notation understood by most musicians. This will
apply both to synthesis methods and to composition methods.</p>

I just want to add that my background is music. I have a BMus
in composition and a doctorate in composition. In fact, early on I
used to regard computers with suspicion, being a pen and paper
person myself. But then with electroacoustic music, it seemed the
way to go and I started to enjoy the scientific/technical side of it
Coding is something  I picked up along the way and maths I have
mostly taught myself (although I did a lot at high-school). Reading
John ffitch's and Istvan Varga's code (among others)
also taught me a lot. Getting involved in Csound development has
been very good for my own education. Although I had good experience
on the signal processing side, as well as C++, from developing the
SndObj library, I learned considerably from watching others do things.

I really want to see the full separation of engine and language,

New languages (also interpreted) can be used to control the engine,

<h4>Contributions to Csound 5:</h4>
 </td>
 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
Istvan overhauled and refined the Csound API, adding many new functions and pruning
where necessary.  He added a more flexible interface for loadable modules, implemented
dynamic loading of real-time audio modules, Midi modules, and utilities.  Istvan moved
all of the existing utilties to a library and fixed most of them to work with Csound 5.
He wrote optional real-time modules for directly using operating system-specific
libraries such as ALSA, MME, and Jack, allowing the lowest possible latencies.
Istvan made improvements to the rtpa and pmidi modules and reimplemented Midi file
reading with many improvements.  Istvan wrote many new opcodes including freeverb,
reverbsc, string manipulation opcodes, loop opcodes, chnset and chnget, ftconv, and diskin2.
He made improvements to the software bus and OSC opcodes.  Much of the final work towards 
multiple-instantiation and reentrancy, including weeding out static variables, was done by
Istvan.  He added the --expression-opt flag, new message formats, timing code, new random 
code, modular FFT support, an improved --sched option, improved FLTK threading, a 
cross-platform means of setting environment variables, and a utility for making CSDs.
Istvan added a string variable type and global f-variables to the orchestra language.  
He also added a new localization system and new code for locating and opening files.
Istvan provides the RPM packages for Linux users and Zip packages for Windows users.
Finally, Istvan has made countless bug fixes to Csound 5 and provided many useful
examples and much support to its users!

<h4>Contributions to Csound 5:</h4>

 </td>
 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
<p>When Csound 5 first got started it was a bit of a rough transition.
Most of my efforts then were to try to ask good questions that would
help clarify what everyone was working on.  I spent a great deal of my
time at the beginning compiling Csound 5 on the platforms I had
available to me (which was primarily Linux and Windows and occasionally
OS X) and reporting any issues I had, whether it was the build system,
broken opcodes, or any other bugs and differing behavior that Csound 5
had compared to Csound 4.  I view my contributions to Csound 5  as being
mostly in the department of testing and trying to ask good questions
of the developers as well as helping others who were getting into
Csound 5 themselves.</p>

<p>In terms of opcodes, I did have a hand in the current set of opcodes
based on fluidsynth. They were originally created by Michael Gogins
but I had a different use case so I modified them to produce a second
wrapping; we eventually managed to merge our efforts to what exists
now.  I also played a small part in a few other opcodes which were
mostly implemented by Istvan Varga (string-indexed software bus,
ftgentmp), but my role there was mostly as a user making requests and
discussing implementation details.</p>

<p>I also helped a little bit with the transition to using Sourceforge
for Csound and did work on the build system. Also, when Kevin Conder
moved on from maintaining the Alternative Csound Reference Manual,
with a little help from him at the start, I continued on with that
work and did the transition from Docbook SGML to Docbook XML and
worked out the new toolchain to use for building the manual. This
seemed to help the manual efforts a great deal as others had better
luck setting up an XML toolchain than they did an SGML toolchain, so
others were more inclined to get involved with working on the manual.
I continue to do builds and releases of the manual as well as help
others when they contribute to it.</p>

<p>[<i>Editor's Note:</i> Steven also did some work on modularizing the
opcodes and eliminating globals.]</p>

<h4>Vision for Csound:</h4>
 </td>
 <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
<p>I think Csound as a program is now in as great a shape as its ever
been.  Looking forward,  I'd like to see support for multiple
processors and eventually multiple computers for rendering Csound
projects. As efficient a tool as Csound is (and it *is* a very
efficient program), due to the things I'm working on musically with my
Orchestral Composition library and blue, I find that I'm bumping into
limits of what my CPU can do in realtime which affects my music-making
experience.  Multicore CPU's are becoming more affordable and widely
available and I'd love to be able to take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Csound is a very mature and rich tool for making music.  I've been
very satisfied in working with it and think that the future is very
bright for Csound.  I'm looking forward to making music with the tool
for years and years to come.</p>
