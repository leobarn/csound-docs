<h2>Introduction</h2>




A great deal of work has gone into the development of Csound5, and with
it a number of new features which are useful for users both composing
with Csound and developing with it. &nbsp;Amongst the many new
opcodes
that have been added to Csound5 are the "chn" set of opcodes. These
opcodes are able to be used as a way of communicating between a host
application and the Csound engine, but they can also be very useful
within Csound alone. Acting as a global string-indexed map, the use of
the chn opcodes allows for new techniques in approaching Csound
instrument design.
<p>The focus of this article will be to analyze traditional
Csound
instrument design to show how it puts limitations on reusability of
instruments, then to take a look at the chnset and chnget opcodes to
see how we can use these to get past these limitations to create
reuable, encapsulated instruments.<br>
</p>






<h2>I. Csound Instrument Dependencies<br>




</h2>




<p>Csound instrument's often have dependencies: things which
exist outside the instrument code body but which the instrument depends
on. &nbsp;Sometimes this is intentional as part of the instrument
design and the way the instrument is meant to be used. &nbsp;Other
times, dependencies are left outside of the instrument body because
that used to be the only way to do it.</p>
<p>The most common dependency which an instrument relies on
are those of ftables created either in the SCO using f-statements or
created in the ORC using ftgen statements. There are other types of
dependencies as well,&nbsp;such as global variables, but for the
scope of this article we will only look at how to deal with ftable
dependencies, as the techniques for working with ftable dependencies
may also apply to other dependencies.</p>



<p>We'll start off with a simple instrument that depends on an ftable,
examine the benefits and drawbacks of coding in this style, and then
take a couple other views on how create the same basic instrument but
coded in different ways, each time handling the dependency in a new
way. &nbsp;In the end, we'll take a look at the techniques introduced
and look at things to be aware about when using these techniques.<br>
</p>


<p> </p>



<h2>II. Using f-statement table</h2>




<p>Let's take a look at a very basic Csound instrument and its
dependency:</p>




<pre>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;<br><br>&lt;CsInstruments&gt;<br>sr=44100<br>ksmps=1<br>nchnls=2<br><br>instr 1 ; Sine Oscilator Instrument<br><br>iamp 	= ampdb(p4)<br>ipch 	= cpspch(p5)<br>itable 	= 1 ; sine<br><br>aout 	oscil3 1, ipch, itable<br><br>aout	= aout * iamp<br><br>	outs aout, aout<br><br>endin<br><br>&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;<br><br>&lt;CsScore&gt;<br><br>f1 0 65537 10 1 ; sine wave<br><br>i1 0 1 70 8.00<br>i1 + . .  8.01<br>i1 + . .  8.02<br>i1 + . .  8.01<br>i1 + 4 .  8.00<br><br>&lt;/CsScore&gt;<br><br>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;</pre>




<p>The above example contains an instrument that depends on
an&nbsp;ftable . &nbsp;The ftable is declared in the SCO
section of the CSD. &nbsp;Note: The ftable is declared outside of
the instrument's code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This method of Csound instrument design is not unusual and in fact
is probably the most common style found in Csound code. Historically,
this was the only way to do it until the ftgen opcode was created. In terms of reusability, the above offers:</p>


<ul>


  <li>a global ftable, reusable by many different instruments and
instances of those instruments, thus making efficient use of memory by
not having to create the ftable every time it is needed</li>


</ul>


However, there are some drawbacks to this:<br>


<ul>


  <li>Ftables are referenced by number, thus requiring&nbsp;the user to remember what the number refers to</li>


  
  
  <ul>


    <li>The above may be fine if the user has a standard set of
tables
and memorizes the meaning of the table number (i.e. I always use ftable
1 as a sine
wave), but on the other hand, sharing this with others will require
either leaving comments as to what the ftable means, or requiring the
next user (even if yourself) to reread and interpret the meaning of the
ftable statement.</li>


    <li>The number in the ftable statement&nbsp;could be replaced with a macro to help with remembering what the ftable means, i.e.:<br>


      
      
      <pre>#define SINE_TABLE # 1 #<br><br>f $SINE_TABLE 0 65537 10 1</pre>


I tend to avoid using macros myself as I find them hard to use as well as to debug
if there are problems. I also find it makes the code a bit harder to read for myself.
&nbsp;</li>


  
  
  </ul>


  <li>Ftables are defined in the SCO file or CsScore section of the
CSD, away from the instrument definition. &nbsp;If your instrument
usage is such that you are expecting to reuse instruments with many
different ftables, this is beneficial, but if your instrument
is&nbsp;tightly coupled with this dependency and you're expecting to
copy and reuse this instrument with its ftables as a whole, this can
make it a little difficult to manage.</li>
  <li>If you copy your instrument into a new ORC or CSD, you have to
also find and copy the ftable statements that the instrument depends
upon into the SCO or CSD. &nbsp;If you are copying the instrument into
a project that already has numerous other ftables already defined, you
will have to manually check if your ftable statements clash numerically
by ID with other ftable statements, and if so, you&nbsp;will have to
modify your ftable statement numbers and also your instrument code to
refer to the new ftable number</li>


</ul>



<p>The ability to share ftables is very useful for making efficient
instruments, but defining ftables with f-statements can make it
difficult to make easily reusable instruments. &nbsp;<br>
</p>





<h2>III.&nbsp;Using ftgen table</h2>



<p>The following example shows another way of creating the same
instrument, but using ftgen statements in the ORC instead of an
f-statement in the SCO:</p>




<pre>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;<br><br>&lt;CsInstruments&gt;<br>sr=44100<br>ksmps=1<br>nchnls=2<br><br>gi_sine ftgen 0, 0, 65537, 10, 1 ; sine wave<br><br>instr 1 ; Sine Oscilator Instrument<br><br>iamp 	= ampdb(p4)<br>ipch 	= cpspch(p5)<br>itable 	= gi_sine ; sine<br><br>aout 	oscil3 1, ipch, gi_sine<br><br>aout	= aout * iamp<br><br>	outs aout, aout<br><br>endin<br><br>&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;<br><br>&lt;CsScore&gt;<br><br>i1 0 1 70 8.00<br>i1 + . .  8.01<br>i1 + . .  8.02<br>i1 + . .  8.01<br>i1 + 4 .  8.00<br><br>&lt;/CsScore&gt;<br><br>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;</pre>




<p>Using an ftgen statement instead of a SCO f-statement gives us some
flexibilty. &nbsp;The table is auto-assigned a number and that number
is stored in a global variable. &nbsp;The global variable can be given
an easy to remember name that signifies what that ftable is. &nbsp;In
this case, now instead of referring to ftable 1 in the instrument code
we are referring to ftable gi_sine. &nbsp;</p>


<p>With this method, we still maintain the advantage of being able to
share ftables between instruments, as was the case with the f-statement
table instrument in section II. With the above, we also gain:</p>


<ul>


  <li>Clearly defined label for the ftable, thus making it easier to remember what that ftable contains</li>


  <li>Ftable is now contained in the ORC or CsInstruments section of the CSD, staying closer to the instrument code that depends on it</li>


  <li>When copying this instrument into a new project, it is likely
that if another ftable already exists in the new project with the same
name as the gi_sine ftable, that they will be likely be the same table
(and&nbsp;for f-statements, it is not likely that ftable 1 in one
project means the same thing as ftable 1 in another)</li>


</ul>


The above method gives us a number of advantages in making it easier to
manage our instrument code as well as making it easier to reuse our
instruments in other projects. &nbsp;However, there are still some
drawbacks:<br>


<ul>


  <li>The ftable dependency that the instrument has still remains
outside of the instrument definition, thus when trying to reuse the
instrument in another project it will still require to find the ftgen
statements the instrument depends on and moving them over to the new
project. &nbsp;This can be tedious with projects with very large
orchestras.</li>


</ul>


<br>


<h2>IV. Using ftgen with chnset/chnget</h2>



<p>With Csound5 there are many new opcodes and with them they have openned
  new techniques for coding instruments. &nbsp;For the purpose of creating a
  completely encapsulated instrument we'll be using the chnset and chnget opcodes.
  The chnset and chnget opcodes allow for accessing a global string-indexed
  software bus whose purpose as a bus is to communicate values to and from a
  host which also reads the bus. However, these opcodes can also be used in a
  much different way.</p>


<p>In programmer terms, the bus that backs the chnset/chnget opcodes is a global
  map. In C++, this might be defined as map&lt;string,float&gt;. In layman terms, what
  this allows is us to look at the bus and get values for a given string as well
  as set what that string means. </p>


<p>For example:</p>


<pre>itablenum 	chnget	"table_sine"<br>			chnset 	20, "table_sine"</pre>


<p>Here, in the first line, we're looking to see what the current value of "table_sine"
  is on the bus. If it has not been defined before, the value will default to zero. (We
  will be using this feature shortly to determine if a table has been defined).
  The second line sets the value of "table_sine" to 20. If you were to call chnget
  again after the chnset line, as in the following:</p>

<pre>			chnset 	20, "table_sine"<br>itablenum 	chnget	"table_sine" </pre>

<p> itablenum would be set to&nbsp;the value 20.</p>

<p>With the chnget and chnset opcode as well using the ftgen opcode, we
have everything we need to create a completely encapsulated instrument.
To do so, the basic technique will be:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Check to see if the table we are depending on is defined.&nbsp;</li>

  <li>If it is already defined, use pre-existing table.</li>

  <li>If it is not defined, create the table and use.</li>

</ol>

Modifying the instrument from Section III, we now have:<br>

<br>

<pre>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;<br><br>&lt;CsInstruments&gt;<br>sr=44100<br>ksmps=1<br>nchnls=2<br><br><br>instr 1 ; Sine Oscilator Instrument<br><br>iamp 	= ampdb(p4)<br>ipch 	= cpspch(p5)<br><br>itable	chnget	"table_sine"<br><br>if (itable == 0) then<br>	itable	ftgen 	0, 0, 65537, 10, 1 ; sine wave<br>	chnset	itable, "table_sine"<br>endif<br><br>print itable<br><br>aout 	oscil3 1, ipch, itable<br><br>aout	= aout * iamp<br><br>	outs aout, aout<br><br>endin<br><br>&lt;/CsInstruments&gt;<br><br>&lt;CsScore&gt;<br><br>i1 0 1 70 8.00<br>i1 + . .  8.01<br>i1 + . .  8.02<br>i1 + . .  8.01<br>i1 + 4 .  8.00<br><br>&lt;/CsScore&gt;<br><br>&lt;CsoundSynthesizer&gt;</pre>

<p>Notice now that everything we need for the instrument is contained
  within the instrument body itself. You are now able to take the instrument
  and easily copy and paste it into another project or share it with others knowing
  that there is a good chance it will be able to just be added to a project and
  work right out of the box. </p>

<p>When running the CSD, you'll find from the print statement will
alway prints the same value for itable, telling us that itable has been
set only once, and therefore the ftable create with ftgen has only been
created once.</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tips On Usage<br>
</span>
<ul>
  <li>When working multiple dependencies, it is useful to use one
special key to check for as a signifier if this instrument's
dependencies as a whole has been initialized, rather than to check if
each individual dependency is initialized. It is more efficient as well
as you'll only have one check done when running the instrument instead
of one for every dependency. &nbsp;An example of this is:<br>
    <br>
    <pre>iInit	chnget	"myinstrument.isInitialized"<br>itab1	chnget	"myinstrument.table1"<br>itab2	chnget	"myinstrument.table2"<br><br>if (iInit == 0) then<br>	chnset 	1, "iInit"<br><br>	itab1	ftgen 	0, 0, 65537, 10, 1 ; sine wave<br>	itab2	ftgen	0, 0, 65537, 11, 1 ; cosine wave<br><br>	chnset 	itab1, "myinstrument.table1"<br>	chnset 	itab2, "myinstrument.table2"<br>endif</pre>
  </li>
  <li>It is useful to have a strategy/approach to naming the keys you
will use, as you'll want to make sure you don't unnecessarily duplicate
tables so as to save memory&nbsp;as well as to insure not having a
clash (defining the same key with different values) so as to have
unexpected results. &nbsp;I'd reccomend to use at least one prefix that
gives&nbsp;a scope as to where the dependency will be used, together
with the name of what the depdenecy means. &nbsp;For example, using a
key of "global.sine" could signify that this table is meant to be a
table that all instruments may use, while a key of "myPad.table1" may
be an ftable that is really only going to be used in your pad
instrument. &nbsp;(In other words, many instruments may be looking to
use and or define a sine ftable, but no other instrument is really
going to be using myPad's table1.) &nbsp;If you'd like to be very sure
that your instrument's table won't clash, you could use a unique
idenifier, such as your name or the url of your website (a Java
convention for package naming). &nbsp;For example,
"com.kunstmusik.global.sine".</li>
  <li>Another reason to be careful about naming your keys for
chnset/chnget is that the values in the chnset/chnget bus are also
accessible by host applications, which is something either to design
for and use or to take caution to avoid clashing with values a host may
assume to use.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
