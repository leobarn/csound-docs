<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
      <p>The <code>planet</code> opcode is a fun effect: it provides a filter that models a
      planet orbiting around a binary star. What does that sound like? Well the
      orbit can get really unstable and the sound can go into escape velocity,
      all sorts of strange things can happen! This opcode is a member of the same
      family as <code>moogvcf</code> and <code>pareq</code>.  It is a filter model that does
      some of the calculation within the opcode and some of the work within the
      Csound code to make it actually generate sound.</p>

<h2>I. Basic Description
</h2>      
	  <p>Here is the basic call you make to invoke the opcode:</p>
	  
      <pre>ax, ay, az planet kmass1, kmass2, ksep, ix, iy, iz, ivx, ivy, ivz, 
	  idelta [, ifriction] [, iskip]</pre>

<p>These are the notes on the variables for this opcode, taken from the Csound documentation:</p> 

<ol><h4>Initialization</h4>
      <p id=qczq3>
        <i>ix, iy, iz</i> -- the
        initial x, y and z coordinates of the planet
      </p>
      <p id=qczq6>
        <i>ivx, ivy, ivz</i> --
        the initial velocity vector components for the planet.
      </p>
      <p id=qczq9>
        <i>idelta</i> -- the
        step size used to approximate the differential equation.
      </p>
      <p id=qczq12>
        <i>ifriction</i>
        (optional, default=0) -- a value for friction, which can used to keep
        the system from blowing up
      </p>
      <p id=qczq15>
        <i>iskip</i> (optional,
        default=0) -- if non zero skip the initialization of the filter. (New in
        Csound version 4.23f13 and 5.0)
      </p>

        <h2 id=qczq19>
          <font id=bsyc0 size=3>Performance</font>
        </h2>
        <p id=qczq20>
          <i>ax, ay, az</i> --
          the output x, y, and z coordinates of the planet
        </p>
        <p id=qczq23>
          <i>kmass1</i> -- the
          mass of the first star
        </p>
        <p id=qczq26>
          <i>kmass2</i> -- the
          mass of the second star
        </p>
      </div></ol>
	  
<h2>II. Use of Planet Opcode</h2>

<p>The description above from the <i>Csound Manual</i> is not everything we need.   To make this opcode work we have to go through four phases:</p> 

      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Setup an initial tone.</b> This can be any sound generator I want to use.
          The example in the <i>Csound Manual</i> uses a simple oscillator, but since I am using
          this for music rather than for a sound effect, I will use the waveguide flute
          (<code>wgflute</code>)to produce my basic tone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Figure out x, y, z coordinates.</b> This section processes the x, y, z
          coordinates of the 3D location of our sound through the <code>planet</code> opcode, which
          does some neat calculus on them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Place the tone within 3D space.</b> We can use the numbers output by
          Planet, using x y z, and pass those into the <code>spat3d</code> opcode, a 3D sound
          spatializer to actually make the numbers sonically useful. This
          renders the abstract output of <code>planet</code> into a 3D sound rendering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Convert to stereo.</b> Then we need to take the output from the 3D sound
          spatializer and convert it to a stereo signal so that your can hear it with
          normal headphones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Output the sound.</b> I use the clip filter here to keep the tone from
          distorting, mostly because the flute will tend to clip without this.
          It is useful to put a limiter on any output when you use more than
          one note at a time, as their amplitudes are additive.
        </li>
      </ol>
	  

      <p>In this example I use the <code>wgflute</code> opcode to create a basic tone.
      I am using this for a musical effect, so the rotation is almost like
      bowing, or like hearing a person playing a really big and loud flute while
      swinging on a swing set! If you set the <i>ifriction</i> level really high you
      can even use <code>planet</code> for a kind of tremolo autopan effect. In my example I
      have three notes.  They start off with a one second delay between them so
      you get a nice beating between the tones. You can also use Planet for
      sound effects. If you tweak the settings you can turn the flute into the
      sound of a laser blaster or space debris.</p>

      <p>So that is a pretty large chunk of code! However <code>planet</code> is a fairly complex
      opcode. It is not a normal generator or filter. You do not have to use it for
      its original intended purpose. It is useful for lots of game effects,
      especially Space Invaders or other types of space games. You can simulate
      the movement of objects around the field. You could also use it as an
      auto-panner, or even for creating sounds that can manipulate brain waves
      with very tight and rapid orbits.</p>
	  
	  <h2>III. Conclusion</h2>
	  
      <p>One last word on the <i>ifric</i> parameter: besides simply keeping the opcode from "blowing
      up" it can also be used to change the "tightness" of the effect. This lets
      you tweak the sound to go from a real orbit sound to something like a
      tremolo autopanner.</p>
      
	  <p>
      There are some VST plugins out there that attempt to do the same thing as
      Planet, but I have not found anything quite this powerful that you could
      buy. This opcode has been around since 1998, so it just goes to show
      how Csound continues to be ahead of everyone else, even when the opcode is
      ten years old!</p>
