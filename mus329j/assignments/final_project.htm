<h1 align="center">MUS 329J Final Exam/Project</h1>
<p align="center">Due at the Final Exam, Wednesday, Dec. 13th, 2 PM</p>
<p align="left">The final project should consist of a CD-ROM (PC
  format) containing the following
files: </p>
<ol>
  <li>an original Csound orchestra</li>
  <li>two Csound scores</li>
  <li>any related
        sound files or MIDI
          files
          required
      to run those scores</li>
  <li>the audio output files from both scores (in
        .wav or .aiff format)</li>
</ol>
<p>One score should generate an original piece of computer music
  between 4-6 minutes in length; the other score should generate a set of example
  sounds
      that show the capabilities of your individual instruments. You may include
      as many
      instruments as you like in your orchestra, but you should have at least
  three different kinds of sound-generating instruments and at least two sound
  processing
  instruments
      (i.e., instruments that apply effects and get their inputs from     global
  variables). Original instrument designs are preferred, but it's
  OK to use adaptations of examples handed out in class,
  or found in
  the textbooks, as long as you
  indicate the sources, and you use them in ways that show you understand them.
  You can also re-use any instruments that you created in  homework assignments.</p>
<p>Use the template orchestra (posted on 11/14) as a starting point. Your orchestra
  must include at least one granular synthesis instrument, one phase vocoder
  instrument,
  and
  one sample
  playback
  instrument (soundin,
  diskin, or loscil). </p>
<p>You may use an audio editor to edit source sounds,
          but the composition and example output audio files should be able to
      be generated directly using only your orchestra, scores, and source sounds.
    You may also use Blue or CMask to generate the score for your composition,
    if desired. Your grade
will be based on the following criteria:</p>
<p align="left">50%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technical [points deducted for syntactical
or conceptual errors, inefficient programming, samples out of range, foldover,
etc.]</p>
<p align="left">20%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Programming Style [points added for clean
code, good comments, self-documenting variable names, etc.]</p>
<p align="left">20%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrated Knowledge of Csound [points
added for implementing various algorithms, showing what you have learned] </p>
<p align="left">10%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Composition/Creativity [points added for
good composition, creative uses of Csound, etc.]</p>
