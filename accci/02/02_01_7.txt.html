This is the additive part of Risset's 'Linear and Exponential Decay 
Experiments'.  In his score the composer uses only three parallel 
building blocks, but this can be extended to any number, if there 
is a wish to do so.  In section 1 the waves with the higher harmonic 
content decay faster.  This situation is often encountered in natural 
vibrating systems.  The example of section 2 adds a slight detuning 
to add liveliness.  In section 3, the waves with lower harmonic 
content decay first (not often found in nature), and section 4 adds 
a small detuning once more.  The noise in sections 3 and 4 stems
from the foldover components of the square wave f31.  Section 5
repeats section 1, and the last section detunes the three
oscillators just a little more than was the case earlier on.
(Risset 1969: #300)
