Three oscillators are connected in a manner such as to form a
basic instrument with LFO control of pitch. 

The LFO function is variable and a few linear functions exemplify
how the pitch parameter can be managed in a continuous fashion.
The instrument gives one opportunities for any pitch envelopes
that one can imagine. These contours are scanned at the rate of
the LFO, which is irate times per note. In this design, irate is
duration dependent. Since it is an LFO, frequencies =&lt; 20 hz 
are required.  Above that limit begins the domain of FM. For f32 
and f33, the instrument 01_40_1 coincides with part 2 of #100, 
see also 1_11_1. One function leaves the frequency unmodified, 
while the other function furnishes a frequency rise from 90% to 
100%.  This type of design enables us to model subtle glissandi 
and to drive them from within the score file by defining the pitch 
time function for each note.  Next we display two other linear 
functions steering frequency.  F37 and f40 are selected from #511 
(glissandi with constant frequency differences).  Risset applied 
very long note durations to this instrument.  Also, the composer 
lets the glissandoing sounds enter with ca. 1 sec delay from each 
other.  This way the tones follow the same pitch envelope, the pitch 
of the first tone is ahead of the pitch of the second while their 
frequency difference remains constant.  We did not repeat the chase. 
F38 descends two octaves, f39 ca. a sixth. (Risset 1969: #100, 
Risset 1969: #511) </pre>
