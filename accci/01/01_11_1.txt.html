This instrument enables us to add a percentage of random
variation and a vibrato to the amplitude value.
 
Here we show how three different percentages of amplitude
increase the roughness of the tone.  The experiment is repeated at
a higher random UG frequency.  This increases the noise.  Due to
the design of this instrument, the percentage added to the
amplitude in the final output signal is half of the demanded
value: i.e. 25% output where 50% is specified in the score.

The instrument appears in Risset's flute-like passage #100 which
is actually produced by two instruments glued together in the
manner of musique concrète.  In his comment to the first part of
this twin design, Risset remarks that the contribution of RANDI
to the overall sound is negligible.  The second part of #100 is
reproduced as 01_40_1 and the complete flute-like instrument is
classified as 80_01_1. (Risset 1969: #100)
