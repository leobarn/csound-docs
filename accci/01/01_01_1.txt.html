The basic instrument to synthesize pitched sounds consists of a
periodic waveform and an amplitude envelope. In SWSS this is
realized in the most general way by two oscillators: the envelope
is generated by setting one oscillator's frequency to 1/idur.
This way the oscillator will simply scan a given function table
once per note, independent of the note duration.  The periodic
waveform is generated according to the GEN function table which
has been assigned to the second oscillator.  GEN 10 is utilized
for complex waves with equal strength harmonics.  GEN 09 serves
to generate complex wavetables, where strengths and ratios of the
individual components are free. GEN 05 or 07 generate exponential
and linear function tables containing discontinuities. These
functions are also successful in serving as waveforms, but
foldover may lead to unwanted quantities of noise in the output.

The instrument demonstrates a number of different waveforms:
complex waves with between one and eleven harmonics, complex
waves with weighted partials, and a number of linear waveforms
(foldover components are negligible at this frequency). The
linear waveforms are followed by a number of linear and
exponential envelopes.  During this display, the wave is held
constant: linear waveform f42. 

In the f statements that generate the exponential tables, a
maximum value of 10000 had at first lead to a value of .0001 at
the extremes of the table (after rescaling). This very low value
of .0001 resulted in noisy cutoffs. A max value of 1024 (2**10)
is better. See also discussion of values for iatdec, instruments
01_01_2B and 01_01_5.

Some linear time functions and a few wave spectra are shown in
