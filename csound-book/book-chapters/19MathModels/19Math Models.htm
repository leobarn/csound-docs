It is based on the solution of the wave equation, a differential equation which describes the behavior of a wave in a medium.</p>		<p><img src="DOCS/mathm1.gif" sgi_src="/tmp_mnt/home/bull6/hpm/reality/mathmodl/mathm1.gif" sgi_native_src="/tmp_mnt/home/bull6/hpm/reality/mathmodl/mathm1.gif"> (1)</p>		<p>Where</p>		<p>U is the wave function,</p>		<p>c is the speed of propagation of the wave in the medium,</p>		<p>Uii is the second derivative of the wave function with respect to i.</p>		<p>Boundary values and initial conditions are usually specified as well.1,2 Plucked string instruments and many wind instruments can be approximated by the one dimensional wave equation. For wind instruments breath pressure is usually given as an input to the system. A drum membrane can be approximated by the two dimensional wave equation. Solving the wave equation mathematically is often difficult, and solving the wave equation numerically is computationally intensive.</p>		<p>Digital waveguides provide a computationally efficient method of expressing the wave equation.3 For a general one dimensional case a bidirectional delay line is used to simulate samples of a traveling wave and its reflection. A more complex system may have a bidirectional delay line for each separately vibrating section.</p>		<p>It should also be noted that commercial implementation of instruments in this section may be subject to certain Stanford University and other patents.</p>		<p><b>A Waveguide Bass</b></p>		<p>This instrument is derived from the Karplus-Strong algorithm, one of the most easily implemented waveguide models4. It is accomplished as follows: Fill a delay line with random numbers, take the average of the current output and the previous output, and add this average to the input of the delay line. This simple procedure produces sounds remarkably like a plucked string.</p>		<p><img src="DOCS/mathm2.gif" sgi_src="/tmp_mnt/home/bull6/hpm/reality/mathmodl/mathm2.gif" sgi_native_src="/tmp_mnt/home/bull6/hpm/reality/mathmodl/mathm2.gif"></p>		<p><b>Figure 1. </b>A block diagram for the Karplus-Strong Algorithm.</p>		<p>The initial noise in the delay line is representative of a string in a high energy state. The average is a type of digital filter. It represents damping which occurs at the ends of the string. This simple delay line, filter, feedback sequence is typical of waveguide instruments.</p>		<p>At low frequencies the initial noise begins to dominate the sound in the Karplus-Strong algorithm. To eliminate this problem and more closely simulate a plucked string's initial state, a filtered triangle waveform was selected as an initial state of the delay line.</p>		<pre>iplk    =       1/ifqc*p6                                    kenvstr <a href="../../../2%20CD1/Reference/Manual4.0/siggen/line.htm">linseg</a>  0,ipluck/4,-p4/2,ipluck/2,p4/2,ipluck/4,0,p                  3-ipluck,0                                   aenvstr =       kenvstr                                      ainput  <a href="../../../2%20CD1/Reference/Manual4.0/sigmod/port.htm">tone</a>    aenvstr,200                                  </pre>		<p>The duration of the initial pulse, parameter <i>p6</i>, can give the effect of different plucking styles.</p>		<p>Filters and initial conditions can introduce an offset from zero.

To solve this problem a special type of filter called a DC blocker is introduced.</p>		<pre>ablkin   <a href="../../../2%20CD1/Reference/Manual4.0/syntax/assign.htm">init</a>  0                                            ablkout  <a href="../../../2%20CD1/Reference/Manual4.0/syntax/assign.htm">init</a>  0                                            ablkout  =     afeedbk-ablkin+.99*ablkout                   ablkin   =     afeedbk                                      ablock   =     ablkout                                      </pre>		<p>The sum of the input and the DC blocked feedback is fed into a delay line of length 1/frequency.

This can be tricky because overblowing occurs at a lower pressure for low frequencies. Retuning the flute would also be required.</p>		<p><b>A Waveguide Clarinet</b></p>		<p>The next instrument considered is a waveguide clarinet derived from an instrument by Perry Cook.6 In this instrument a bi-directional delay line is used. A bidirectional delay line consists of two delay lines of the same length whose outputs feed each others inputs. Breath pressure is fed into the system at the input to the forward delay line and at the output of the reflection delay line.</p>		<p><img src="DOCS/mathm4.gif" sgi_src="/tmp_mnt/home/bull6/hpm/reality/mathmodl/mathm4.gif" sgi_native_src="/tmp_mnt/home/bull6/hpm/reality/mathmodl/mathm4.gif"></p>		<p><b>Figure 3. </b>A block diagram for a waveguide clarinet.</p>		<p>Another feature used in this instrument is a feedback table.

This is implemented as a pair of filters. The ouput from the low pass filter feeds the reflection delay line and the output from the high pass filter is scaled and used as the output of the instrument.</p>		<p><b>A Waveguide Drum</b></p>		<p>This instrument is an attempt to extend the waveguide model to two dimensions. There are two parts to this instrument defined as separate Csound instruments: the drum and the drum stick. The drum can be thought of as a square membrane with waves traveling from each of the four corners to each of the other three corners.</p>		<p><img src="DOCS/mathm5.gif" sgi_src="/tmp_mnt/home/bull6/hpm/reality/mathmodl/mathm5.gif" sgi_native_src="/tmp_mnt/home/bull6/hpm/reality/mathmodl/mathm5.gif"></p>		<p><b>Figure 4</b></p>		<p>A simplified diagram for a waveguide square drum.

This send an impulse into the drum membrane. The pitch determines the duration of the impulse and along with the filter can be thought of as specifing the type of the drum stick.</p>		<p>This drum can be adjusted to produce a wide variety of percussion sounds. Sounds similar to a bongo, conga, wood blocks, struck glass bottles, bells and others can be produced.</p>		<p>A pitch dependence on amplitude could be introduced to simulate the drum head tightening during an impact. One drawback of this instrument is the large number of delay lines requiring extensive computation. It is possible this system could be simplified substantially. Another problem with this instrument is that the timbre tends to change with pitch. This presents a problem for reproducing marimba like tones.</p>		<p><b>Discussion</b></p>		<p>Waveguide instruments have introduced a new opportunity for expression in electronic musical instruments. Since they are based on physical systems their response to playing dynamics is similar to the response of an acoustic instrument. Programming a waveguide instrument can be tedious. They are difficult to get to start oscillating, and once they do start oscillating they tend to blow up easily. They are also difficult to tune over a wide range of pitches. Creating waveguide insturments is in some ways similar to creating acoustic instruments. They both require careful crafting and meticulous adjustments to produce quality instruments.</p>		<h3><b>Chaos and Complex Systems</b></h3>		<p><b>Introduction</b></p>		<p>This set of instruments is based on systems of differential equations. Systems of differential equations can exhibit a variety of behaviors ranging from increasing without bound to approaching a constant value. Some of these systems, called strange attractors, exhibit chaotic behavior. They follow a path which is repetitive yet non-repeating. These systems can be used to produce unusual and bizarre timbres because of their complex nature.</p>		<p><b>The Lorenz Attractor</b></p>		<p>The Lorenz Attractor, discovered by Edward Lorenz is one of the first chaotic systems to be discovered.7 It describes the motion of convection currents in a gas or liquid.

If computation of an actual star system is desired the gravitational constant should be included. The one added to the radius squared term should also be omitted.</p>		<p>One modification could be to add more stars to the system. It is diffucult to find a system which remains stable over a long period of time. Eventually a close encounter with a star accelerates the planet to escape velocity from the system.</p>		<p><b>Discussion</b></p>		<p>There seems to be a great deal of room for exploration in this area. There is at least one site on the internet which lists over 40,000 different dynamical systems many of which are useful as tone generators. These systems also work well at low frequencies for modulating pitch, amplitude and panning. At low amplitudes they can be used to introduce subtle complex modulations to otherwise sterile sounds.</p>		<p><b>References</b></p>		<p>1.
