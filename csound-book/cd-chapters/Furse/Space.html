<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>The 'Space' Spatialisation System</TITLE></HEAD><BODY><H1>The 'Space' Spatialisation System</H2><HR><P>This utility spatialises sound using a script, placing and moving mono sound files using three-dimensional co-ordinates. The system will 'render'the same script in stereo, Ambisonics or a crude mono (for speed).</P>Features include:<UL><LI>	Delay lines are used to model	the distance the sound is from the 	listener. Movement induces Doppler 	shift and separate delays are calculated	to the two signals generated for stereo.<LI>	Low-pass filtering and the 	inverse-square law are used to further	process the signal as it travels long	distances.<LI>	Sounds may stay motionless, move in	straight lines or along arcs.<LI>	Pre-spatialised soundfiles can be mixed in	although they must be the same format as	output.<LI>	Angled Cardioid Virtual Microphones 	are used to record the two signals	used for stereo.<LI>	Ambisonic decoding equations are included so the	system can be modified to produce a four-speaker	feed.<LI>	Sounds are reflected off configurable 	walls within a simple room model	generating early reflection images or	cruder echoes. Reflected sound goes	through all other processing. One of 	Eric Lyon's instruments is used to	provide further reverberation.</UL><P>This program was written on Linux and has been testedwith IRIX. It should run without too much trouble onother UNIXes. It will not run with DOS or Windows becauseof a reliance on symbolic links.</P><P>The implementation works by shelling out to Csoundso Csound needs to be available at run-time.</P>Compilation requires C, make, YACC and LEX.</P><P>The system is straightforward to use onceset up: mixing lines can be as simple as<NOBR><CODE>2.5 bell1.wav at (0, 1, 0)</CODE></NOBR> indicating that bell1.wav is to be played to the left of the listener 2.5 beats into the mix. Documentation of the syntax is included withthe release.</P><P>Much of the processing is rather qualitative and notaccurate representations of physics. The system is slowwhen asked for much detail. But it works for me.</P><P>To download version 1.06 click <A HREF="Space_v1.06.tgz">here</A>.

Thisversion is much more limited than Space but uses Csoundonly and not C, YACC or LEX.</P><P>Source code is in TGZ format (tar + gzip). See licences included.</P><P> For other Ambisonics information I recommend the <A HREF="http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/mustech/3d_audio/ambison.htm">Ambisonics Page</A> maintained by Dave Malham of the Universityof York Music Technology group. For more general reading on 3D audio Iwould recommend "3D Sound" by Durand R. Begault (1994, Academic Press,Inc.) and the fiercely concise and technical, "Digital AudioSignal Processing" by Udo Zolzer (1997, John Wiley and Sons, also inGerman: 1995, B.G. Teubner Verlag). These books both give excellentset of references.
