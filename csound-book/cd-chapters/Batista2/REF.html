		<p>This material was inspired by M. V. Wickerhauser's work with wave packets, and his ideas about synthesizing complex signals using wave packet <i>tonebursts. </i>The guidelines are described in his classic paper:</p>
		<p><i>M. V. Wickerhauser. </i><a href="ftp://pascal.math.yale.edu/pub/wavelets/papers/acoustic.tex">'Acoustic signal compression with wave packets'</a><i>. Numerical Algorithms Research Group, Department of Mathematics, Yale University.</i></p>
		<p>The algorithms were derived from some public domain <a href="http://www.wavelet.org/wavelet/digest_02/digest_02.14.html#2">Mathematica code</a> that Wickerhauser published on the <a href="http://www.wavelet.org/">Wavelet Digest</a>.</p>
		<p>And the soft threshold method was taken from <i>D. Donoho, I. Johnstone, G. Kerkyacharian and D. Picard,</i> <a href="ftp://playfair.stanford.edu/pub/donoho/asymp.ps.Z">'Wavelet Shrinkage: Asymptopia?'</a></p>
		<p>I also invoked the average/difference paradigm, and the two-sample signal example, from the highly educative paper, <i>Wim Sweldens and Peter Schroder.</i> <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/wim/papers/athome.ps.gz">'Building Your Own Wavelets at Home'</a>.</p>
		<p>To start you off with wavelets, download Chapter 13.10 of the <a href="http://www.ulib.org/Books/Numerical_Recipes/index.html">online books</a> from <a href="http://www.nr.com/">Numerical Recipes</a>, which is an excellent introduction (lets be honest, the whole book is great) and has all the C and Fortran routines to implement a version of the algorithm.</p>
		<p>Additionally, a very good collection of papers (all the classics by Meyer, Daubechies, Coifman, Wickerhauser, Mallat, Sweldens and many others) as well as some tutorials, can be obtained from <a href="http://www.mathsoft.com/wavelets.html">MathSoft's Wavelet Resources</a> site.</p>
		<p>Finally, I must refer Amara Graps' excellent <a href="http://www.amara.com/current/wavelet.html">Wavelet Page</a>, which besides from being the place I first heard about <i>tonebursts</i> (literally), is a well thought and carefully maintained entry point to this whole matter.
