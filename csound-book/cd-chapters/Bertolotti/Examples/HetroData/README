        Trumpet_orig_ds5.het         2.344  sec
        Trumpet_orig_f4.het          2.416  sec

    have been time-stretched to the length of
       
        Violins_ds5.het         3.895  sec
        Violins_f4.het          4.093  sec

    using hetroMix, and the file mixer.stretch (read this later file)
    with the command:

    hetroMix -a 200 -w mixer.stretch Trumpet_original_f4.het Violins_f4.het

    and the output file ``data_mix.het'' renamed accordingly.  Look at
    ``data_mix.info'' to see the actual weights used in the mixing.



>>> The trumpet an violin spectra were mixed with the command:

    hetroMix -w mixer.mix Trumpet_f4.het Violins_f4.het





>>> The base + supplementary files were created with the foloowing commands

        hetroReduce -s 200 -o Trumpet_f4  Trumpet_f4.het
        hetroReduce -s 200 -o Trumpet_ds5 Trumpet_ds5.het
        hetroReduce -s 400 -o Violins_f4  Violins_f4.het
        hetroReduce -s 400 -o Violins_ds5 Violins_ds5.het

    I have saved two .eps files of the base spectrums.  Use hetroPlot to
    visualize other data.
