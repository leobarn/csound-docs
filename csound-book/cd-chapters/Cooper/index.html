Digital Editing Systems and Csound</h1>		<h2>Dr. Robert L. Cooper</h2>		<p><b>INTRO </b></p>		<p>When I first started using<i> Csound </i>I was <i>&quot;perfing&quot;</i> everything on Micro Technology Unlimited's <i>Digi-Sound </i>16 system in a 386 PC clone with <b>8MB RAM!</b> The interface was fine but the processing speed was horrendous. It took forever to compile some of the more CPU intensive opcodes and various orchestra configurations. My recourse to this extraodinary amount of compilation time was to compile smaller files and port the result into a sound editor and then utilize a sequencer to control a sampler, where I would load my sounds. Since then I have found a groove that works for me. I still compile sound files (size not being an issue now) with Csound and port the result to <i>Digidesign's Pro-Tools II </i>editing system and do a lot of composing and final work in that environment. It saves compilation time and eliminates the need to re-write orchestra and score files. I also use a number of editing tools that are available on the MAC such as <i>SoundHack, Hyperprism, Sound Designer II, TurboSynth, SoundEffects</i>, the <i>TDM Plug-ins</i> for Pro-Tools, and occassionally, on the PC, <i>Sound Forge </i>or <i>CoolEdit</i>.</p>		<p><b>Cymbolic </b></p>		<p>I have been using a subtractive synthesis approach in the use of sample processing in my compositions with sound manipulation opcodes. I will be illustrating various orchestra and score files that I used in a composition called <i>Cymbolic.<br>		</i><br>		In Cymbolic, I used two suspended cymbals as sound sample sources (one with a clear attack when struck and the other with less of the initial strike apparent and after editing each for optimal clarity, proceeded to subject each to a number of processes. Using the soundin opcode and Gen 1, I processed the resulting samples using a number of the signal modifiers and generators to bend, transpose, reverberate, filter, and create layers.<br>		<br>		Example 1 displays a stereo sample (a1,a2<i> soundin</i>) with one channel being reverberated within the instrument for timbre enhancement and the 2nd channel as a &quot;dry&quot; component. Each channel is subjected to a different panning function and balanced for amplitude normalization.</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p><b>EX. 1</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>sr=44100</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>kr=2205</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>ksmps=20</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>nchnls=2</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<div align="left">			<p>			<table>				<tr>					<td>instr 1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>k1 linseg 1, p3*.5, 4.7, p3*.5, 2.6 ; time varying reverb loop time</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>k2 linseg 0, p3*.5, 1, p3*.5, 0 ; automated panning</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>k3 expseg 1, p3*.3, .5, p3*.3, .1, p3*.3, .7, p3*.1, .5 ;automated panning</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a1, a2 soundin &quot;cym.snd&quot;, p4</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a3 reverb a2, k1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a4 balance a3, a1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>outs1 (a4*k2)+(a1*k3)</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>outs2 (a4*(1-k2))+(a1*(1-k3))</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>endin</td>				</tr>			</table>			</p>		</div>		<p><b>SCORE</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>2.64</td>				<td>0</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>1</td>				<td>2.64</td>				<td>0</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>1.5</td>				<td>2.64</td>				<td>0</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p>The orchestra is quite simple, but when I inserted p-fields in the place of the values I could create a somewhat lengthy score to generate a number of variations of the original and archived each for use when I moved from the Csound environment to the Pro-Tools Editing System. By increasing and decreasing the reverb time value, the overall color would change and produced interesting dynamic qualities, dependent on the amount of reverberation and loop-time values.<br>		<br>		For example, when the reverb time value was set to about 3.5 or higher the sound became somewhat transparent and when the reverb time value was smaller the sound became more distinct. I used this contrast to achieve a dynamic envelope with the more transparent reverberated sound being a softer dynamic and a dryer sound being a louder dynamic. This would accomodate the dimension of &quot;foreground&quot;, &quot;middleground&quot;, &quot;background&quot; and all of the space in between, similar to the panning function, but mapped into the &quot;front to back space&quot; in the concert hall. The manipulation of these values could be single, hardwired values (values assigned to p-fields that remain the same for the duration of the relevent event) or continuous values (values that changed over time - achieved by using expseg, linen, or linseg).</p>		<p>I utilized 2 different opcodes (<i>linseg</i> and <i>expseg</i>) for panning to contrast a linear motion and an exponential motion in the stereo field in addition to dividing the p3 variable (duration) differently with each opcode statement. (ie. the k2 <i>linseg</i> in example 1 shows a simple arch envelope - p3*.5 p3*.5 and the k3 <i>expseg</i> divides the duration thus - p3*.3 p3*.3 p3*.3 p3*1). One of the primary gestures involves panning from a subtle and sometimes non-existent presence to a more apparent application. The panning aspect played an important role in the composition and I applied different panning methods throughout the work to help define each section or transition.</p>		<p>An example of a panning application that moves within the stereo field at a faster rate of activity, is shown in example 2. (Now I realize that you can also use various gen subroutines to create an even more extreme panning application by using a configuration with the opcodes - table, phasor, GEN 5 0r GEN 7!).</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p><b>EX. 2</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>sr=44100</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>kr=2205</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>ksmps=20</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>nchnls=2</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<div align="left">			<p>			<table>				<tr>					<td>instr 1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>k1 expseg .5, p3*.1, 1, p3*.2, .1, p3*.2, .5, p3*.1, 1, p3*.1, .1, p3*.1, 1, p3*.1, .2, p3*.1, .7 ; panning</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a1 soundin &quot;buzz.snd&quot;, 0</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a2 reson a1, 400, 20,1 ; filter the sample</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a3 balance a2, a1 ; balance the output</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>outs1 a3 * k1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>outs2 a3 * (1-k1)</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>endin</td>				</tr>			</table>			</p>		</div>		<p><b>SCORE</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>1</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>2</td>				<td>1</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p>One of the most useful orchestras, for Cymbolic, is shown in example 3. I used an <i>oscili</i> opcode to oscillate a sample at different speeds (.2 to 1.8) to cycle or read the table containing the sample. I used this orchestra at times with a <i>linseg</i> or <i>expseg</i> opcode to control the frequency in a continuous manner later in the comnposition by inserting values that changed by very small degrees (somewhere between .7 to 1.3). This subtle change in oscillation emulated the colorful timbre variations of an acoustic instrument.</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p><b>EX. 3</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>sr=44100</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>kr=2205</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>ksmps=20</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>nchnls=1</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<div align="left">			<p>			<table>				<tr>					<td>instr 1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a1 oscili 10000, p4, 1 ; load the sample into a table and oscillate according to the p- field entry</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>out a1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>endin</td>				</tr>			</table>			</p>		</div>		<p><b>SCORE</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>f1</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>131072</td>				<td>1</td>				<td>&quot;cym.snd&quot;</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>4</td>				<td>0</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>2</td>				<td>.5</td>				<td>; p4 = frequency of oscillation</td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>.5</td>				<td>2</td>				<td>.7</td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>.9</td>				<td>2</td>				<td>.3</td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>1</td>				<td>2</td>				<td>.9</td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>1.1</td>				<td>6</td>				<td>.2435</td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>1.15</td>				<td>8</td>				<td>.2477</td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p>This worked well for what I needed in a certain section of the work, but I also needed to glissando a modified (step) glissando effect for other sections and I used a modified version of one of James Mobberley's Csound orchestras shown in example 4. This orchestra/score combination worked very well for long glissando gestures and discreet, but somewhat random results. It was particularly useful in the beginning moments of Cymbolic (the low, pitch drifting rumbling sounds). The orchestra and score permit you to glissando using the middle value (p5... 12) to represent how many notes per octave and the first number (p4... -12) to indicate how many steps below and p6 in the score to indicate the destination pitch in steps (9 steps above).</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p><b>EX. 4</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>sr=44100</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>kr=2205</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>ksmps=20</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>nchnls=2</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<div align="left">			<p>			<table>				<tr>					<td>instr 1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>i1=p3</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>i2=1/p3</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>i3=exp(log(2)*p4/p6)</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>i4= exp(log(2)*p5/p6)</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>if p4 = p5 goto nondiv</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>goto rest</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>nondiv: i5=(p4+p5)/2</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>i6=1/(exp(log(2)*i5/p6))</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>goto dur</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>rest: i6=log(i4/i3)/(i4-i3)</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>dur: p3=i1*i6</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>p7=p7*1000</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a1 expseg i2*i3, p3, i2*i4</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a1 phasor a1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>if p8 = -1 goto reverse</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>goto table</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>reverse: a1 = 1 - a1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>table: a2 table a1*(sr*i1), 1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a3=a2*p7</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>outs1 a3</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>outs2 a3</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>endin</td>				</tr>			</table>			</p>		</div>		<p><b>SCORE</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>f1</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>262144</td>				<td>1</td>				<td>&quot;cym.aiff&quot;</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>4</td>				<td>0</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>5</td>				<td>-12</td>				<td>12</td>				<td>9</td>				<td>10</td>				<td>0</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p>Whenever I used an opcode that required an <i>ifn </i>(function table), I used <i>GEN 1 </i>to load the cymbal samples and manipulated the orchestra and score files slightly by changing parameter values when needed. Sometimes I would change the <i>skip time</i> parameter, vary the frequency of oscillation by discrete or continuous values, use the reverse version, and many other processes according to the usefullness of particular opcode functions and parameters.<br>		<br>		In another example, I used the <i>rand </i>opcode and the <i>oscil </i>opcode to control frequency and load the cymbal sample into <i>GEN 1</i> This configuration was the foundation for the reverberated and random cycling of the sample in the middle section of Cymbolic.<br>		<br>		The frequency of the sample will glissando in whatever direction you indicate (ascending or descending values) in the <i>expseg </i>opcode arguments. The <i>kcps </i>argument in the <i>randh </i>opcode points to the 4th parameter field in the score and provides a means for control from event to event (note entries).<br>		<br>		Amplitude is also controlled from the score in most sections and provided a means of controlling the contour of dynamics throughout the work. Example 5 illustrates one of the main orchestra and score files used with this configuration.</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p><b>EX. 5 </b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>sr=44100</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>kr=2205</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>ksmps=20</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>nchnls=1</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<div align="left">			<p>			<table>				<tr>					<td>instr 1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>k2 expseg 1, p3*.2, .4, p3*.3, .7, p3*.3, .5, p3*.2, 1 ; provide random value for the randh opcode</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>k1 randh k2, p4 ; random frequency oscillation in stepped values</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a1 oscili p5, k1, 1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>out a1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>endin</td>				</tr>			</table>			</p>		</div>		<p><b>SCORE</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>f1</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>262144</td>				<td>1</td>				<td>&quot;cym.aiff&quot;</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>4</td>				<td>0</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>0</td>				<td>10</td>				<td>1</td>				<td>10000</td>				<td>; p4=amplitude</td>				<td></td>				<td></td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>2</td>				<td>10</td>				<td>1</td>				<td>10000</td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>i1</td>				<td>5</td>				<td>10</td>				<td>1</td>				<td>10000</td>				<td></td>				<td></td>				<td></td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p>After each sound had been developed and a multitude of variations compiled and saved, I transferred all samples to<i> Digidesign's Pro-Tools Editing System</i>. With an 8 track digital editing environment I was able to cut, paste, duplicate, and re-arrange all the sounds into a sequence that made musical sense to me. Each track has editable graphs for volume and panning in addition to allowing you to seamlessly fade (with a good number of shapes for the crossfade) from one sound to the next. This enabled me to stretch certain aspects of individual sound. This is most evident at the end of Cymbolic. The final cymbal crash was modified with various filters, combined into a single stereo sound file and the last 2 seconds of the original processed sound copied, displaced and layered to prolong the decay.<br>		<br>		It was at this point in the compositional process that I would port certain sounds to <i>SoundDesigner, HyperPrism, </i>or<i> SoundHack </i>for tweaking. I would apply most reverb effects from the <i>Pro-Tools </i>system and bounced everything to 2 track stereo when finished. The <i>Pro-Tools </i>system allows you to edit all samples in a non-destructive manner so that you end up not butchering your original samples by mistake or through system crashes.<br>		<br>		The use of the opcode - <i>randh </i>provided the primary function for most of the section of Cymbolic at ....... (minutes/seconds). Many variations were compiled and examined for application in a time continuum that would portray a sense of contrast to the previous musical material. By cutting, pasting and editing the original compiled samples I arrived at what you hear at this point in the work. The next example is a modified version of the original orchestra ( using a higher sample rate).</p>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p><b>EX. 6</b></p>		<p>		<table>			<tr>				<td>sr=44100</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>kr=2205</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>ksmps=20</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td>nchnls=2</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<div align="left">			<p>			<table>				<tr>					<td>instr 1</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>k1 linseg .5, p3*.1, 1, p3*.7, .1, p3*.1, 1, p3*.1, .5 ; panning function</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>k2 expseg 4, p3*.5, 4.3, p3*.3, 4.8, p3*.2, 4.5 ; varies the speed of sample ;oscillation</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>k3 randh 1.5, k2, p4 ; generates a control signal to provide a series of random ;frequency control values</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>a1 oscil 15000, (k3*1.3)*1.1, 1 ; sample loaded into table and controlled with the oscil opcode</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>outs1 a1 * k1 ; panning</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>outs2 a1 * (1-k1) ; panning</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td>endin</td>				</tr>			</table>			</p>		</div>		<p>		<hr>		</p>		<p>I was unable to generate a consistent reiteration of the sample with this orchestra, but with the help of the<i> Pro-Tools </i>editing sytem I was able to create what I needed by layering and slight displacement of each entry.

Even showing the editing system pictures is somewhat misleading since I periodically &quot;bounced&quot; everything to disk (saving all tracks as either a mono file or split stereo file) to maintain a manageable file in the Pro-Tools environment. This &quot;back and forth&quot; approach was adhered to during most of this work. I would select a series of opcodes that provided the parameter flexibility to achieve certain sound shapes and would port each resulting sound file into an editing system for minute shaping ( cutting off portions of silence, selecting portions of the sound, processing with various functions inherent in the particular editor, layering, eliminating extraneous noise and clicks, etc...).<br>		<br>		Editing in a visual environment provides a fast and efficient means of shaping the macro and micro sonic contours and allows immediate layering of a particular sound or sounds, by way of cutting, pasting and delimiting individual sounds. With a host of powerful editing tools available (free and otherwise), this approach will encourage a more concentrated effort on the compositional process and hopefully, limit the amount of time learning and trying to interpret &quot;code.&quot;	</body></html>
