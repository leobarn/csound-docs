		<p><br>
		<b>Score-11</b> is a score preprocessor written by Aleck Brinkman originally
		for Music 11, at the Eastman School of Music in 1980. It was subsequently
		updated, through 1984. The code was then ported in the late '80's
		to DOS (by Craig Harris). Score-11 also functions remarkably well
		as a score preprocessor for the most recent 486 DOS version of
		Csound, for example. I have used it (in conjunction with Csound)
		primarily to randomize start time and duration parameters (also
		frequencies), with the goal of creating multiple/variable realizations
		of my non-realtime digital works.</p>
		<p>Score-11 is the property of Dr. Aleck Brinkman, who may be reached
		as follows:<br>

		<p>Dr. Brinkman intends (as of July 1998) to produce new and improved
		versions of Score-11 for both PC and Mac platforms. These will
		be made available to interested parties for a fee. Contact him
		for details.</p>
		<p>The version of Score-11 that I used (DOS--dating from at least
		the early '90's), required the following command line:<br>
		<br>
		<b>score11 &lt; score_input_file</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(note that the &lt; is required)</p>
		<p>The program writes its output to the file s.out--a file suitable
		as (.sco) input to Csound.<br>
		</p>
		<p><i><b>Peculiarities/bugs I have observed </b></i>in the current (July 1998) DOS version of Score-11 (these issues
		are to be addressed in the upcoming revision):</p>
		<p>1) The &quot;non-repeating sets&quot; feature does not seem to work.</p>
		<p>2) Rdeviation is undependable in that its range limits are not
		always observed. Also, the &quot;deviation&quot; is added to start time
		(p2) rather than duration (p3), contrary to the documentation.
		(The &quot;range bug&quot; is most unfortunate, as rdeviation could be a
		very useful tool for randomizing durations <i>or</i> start times.) Finally (and as stated), rd must be placed <i>within</i> an instrument block; it applies <i>only</i> to that block, and thus is not available globally.</p>
		<p>3) Due to differences between Music11 (the program's original
		&quot;parent&quot;) and Csound, the Advance, Purge, and Comment statements
		discussed in the documentation are not implemented. Also, the
		End statement does not work correctly in Score-11 (substitute
		*e instead), though this does not seem to matter much (it can
		be omitted).</p>
		<p>One particular limitation of Score-11 has proven especially difficult
		for me: its significantly restricted random number capability.
		(This function has always been the primary rationale for Score-11
		in my work.) Though Score-11 allows for different values of Rseed,
		generating an unlimited quantity of random number series, there
		is no way of &quot;massaging&quot; these numbers other than setting their
		limits and specifying whether or not they are integer. For example,
		it is not possible to rule out immediate repetitions (crucial
		when working with integers), to specify some minimum difference
		between successive values, or to make a later value dependent
		on a previous one. It seems that a more elaborate and powerful
		&quot;musical text processor&quot; for Csound is required to furnish such
		increased functionality. (Or perhaps these are features to be
		hoped for in upcoming revisions.)
