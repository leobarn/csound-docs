COMMENTARY </b>on Four Csound Compositions: <font size="3"><i><b>Via Creativa/Via Transformativa, Gifts, Lux Hominum, &amp; Et Vitam Venturi III</b></i></font><br>		</h1>		<h2>Art Hunkins</h2>		<p><br>		Art Hunkins' interest in electronic music dates from the earliest days of analog synthesizers. He attended Bob Moog's Trumansburg, NY workshop in electronic music in 1965 and shortly thereafter established one of the earliest analog synthesizer-based university electronic music studios, at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. He was studio director at UNCG and teacher of composition, theory and electronic music for 32 years, until retiring in 1997. A composer of a wide range of electro-acoustic (especially live-performance) and conventional works, he creates music that is spiritual in inspiration and meditative in mood. The pieces presented here are his four Csound compositions to date.</p>		<p><br>		<a href="VIAORC.HTM"><b>VIA CREATIVA/VIA TRANSFORMATIVA</b></a> is his earliest Csound endeavor, completed in 1990, but having its roots in an NEH workshop in the 70's at the University of New Hampshire (using Music360 in a mainframe environment). Nearly 20 years later it was completed on a desktop PC! It has the only &quot;fixed&quot; <a href="VIASCO.HTM">score</a> of the group, designed without the score preprocessor <a href="SCORE11.HTM">Score-11</a> in mind. Alternating a single, built-up harmonic series with a seven-inharmonic bell tone, it features random modulation of sinewave frequency with audio-range noise; it &quot;transforms&quot; from pure tone to noise bands and back again (so becoming involved in negative sample increments).</p>		<p><a href="GIFTSORC.HTM"><b>GIFTS (1991)</b></a> is the second piece solely realized in Csound; but here Score-11 preprocessing is required--in this case for the basic purpose of randomizing start and duration times while retaining control over &quot;average event spacing.&quot; Several other parameters are randomized as well: frequency, and &quot;cloud rhythm&quot;--including whether &quot;clouds&quot; are repeated in total or in part. (The &quot;cloud&quot; instrument is <a href="GIFTSORC.HTM">#7</a>). A global reverb (<a href="GIFTSORC.HTM">instrument #8</a>) is used for the &quot;cloud&quot; only.</p>		<p>Whereas the previous works are mono, both LUX HOMINUM (1994) and IN VITAM VENTURI (1995) are here in stereo, though they exist in mono (and several alternate) versions as well. (For alternate versions and further information, please <a href="mailto:abhunkin@hamlet.uncg.edu">contact the composer</a>.) Both make crucial use of Score-11 preprocessing, and additionally invite the user's involvement in customizing the realization.</p>		<p><a href="LUXORC.HTM"><b>LUX HOMINUM</b></a><b> </b>actually comprises eight variable and fixed forms (four written in &quot;straight&quot; Csound; four requiring Score-11 preprocessing). (A previous version of the work is for 2-op FM sound card and MIDI file player. In Cakewalk implementation, several of the randomization and user customizations described below are accomplished through CAL routines.) Two versions are presented here: a &quot;fixed&quot; version using <a href="LUXSCO.HTM">lux.sco</a> and <a href="LUXORC.HTM">lux.orc</a>, and one in which <a href="LUXS11.HTM">lux.s11</a> is to be processed by Score-11 and its &quot;score&quot; output paired with <a href="LUX11ORC.HTM">lux11.orc</a>. Of particular interest in the present versions is the &quot;numinous&quot; quality of the instruments, which is created by applying small amounts of random subaudio amplitude modulation to the audio signal. A similar technique (but in this case random <i>frequency</i> modulation) applies in ET VITAM VENTURI.</p>		<p>User customizable parameters in LUX HOMINUM include the following: variable tempo, basic transposition level, choice of modulation waveform (the piece consists of simple FM bell tones, each based on the identical carrier frequency), and modulation index (for &quot;tone color&quot; control). These factors are fine-tuned in either .sco or .orc files. Additionally, tone color entry order can be manually regulated by the user in the .sco file.</p>		<p><a href="VITAMORC.HTM"><b>ET VITAM VENTURI III</b></a> exists in two previous--in this case live performance--incarnations: ET VITAM VENTURI for two Yamaha PSS480 or PSS680 synthesizers, and ET VITAM VENTURI II for Yamaha FB01 or TX81Z Tone Generator and MIDI Keyboard. The Csound rendition (III) is variable, not fixed, requiring Score-11 for actual <a href="VITAMSCO.HTM">score</a> generation. Its randomized elements are event start/duration and stereo placement. User customization comprises tempo specification, starting pitch (including an option for random selection), and several choices of modulation index (this piece too is based on simple bell tones).</p>		<p>The most unique feature of ET VITAM VENTURI III is its invitation to the user to create his/her own unique bell tones. <a href="VITAMTOR.HTM">Vitamt.orc</a> and <a href="VITAMTSC.HTM">.sco</a> are furnished for this purpose. Complete instructions for such creation are included in the <a href="VITAMTSC.HTM">vitamt.sco</a> file (which is not to be processed by Score-11). From the sonic output of the vitamt files, the user selects the sonorities he/she prefers, and inserts the corresponding values in the scorefile generated by Score-11 and <a href="VITAMS11.HTM">vitam.s11</a>.</p>		<p><br>		As can be readily understood from the above commentary, the composer is particularly interested in <i>variable</i> and multiple renderings of his Csound and other electronic works. In the case of Csound, he does this by randomizing crucial parameters (within specified limits) and by inviting the user to &quot;customize&quot; realizations. A major motivation for these efforts is the desire to recreate in the Csound environment some of the &quot;you are there&quot; excitement of live (concert) performance, where each rendition is unique to some degree. In this regard, <i>MIDI-controlled, real-time</i> Csound is a new creative adventure on which the composer is looking to embark with great expectation.</p>		<p><b>N.B</b>. A brief word about <b>Score-11</b>: for basic information about Score-11 and its upcoming availability in a revised version, see <a href="SCORE11.HTM">score11.htm</a>. Since Score-11 user materials are NOT included here, files for the works discussed above always include traditional .sco scores--so that representative renditions of these compositions may be readily experienced.	</body></html>
