Temporal Synthesis</h1>		<h2>Noel Bush</h2>		<p>		<table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="7" width="550">			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">How might a musical system for computer synthesis organically integrate temporal structure with sonic organization? The following describes my attempt to develop a prototype of such a system, using the C language, the Cscore function library, and Csound. I began with a <a href="#fig1">drawing</a>, produced prior to the formulation of the system and conceived as the raw image of a primary piece of music yet unheard. Rather than create my system and <i>then</i> &quot;output&quot; its music, I decided to regard the drawing as a full-fledged score, <i>for which</i> I had to create the appropriate system in order to hear the music.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">I directed my efforts toward producing a musical system in which &quot;time&quot; would not function as an axis against which &quot;sound&quot; &quot;happens&quot;, but instead in which sound and time would manifest as inextricably linked properties of the whole music. In the system I would construct, all the &quot;times&quot; of a piece-all relations and correspondences observed purely <i>within</i> the system, not mere measured quantities-would manifest as truly organic and manipulable aspects of the music rather than as gridlines laid over static values of &quot;pitch&quot;, &quot;interval&quot;, etc.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">From my point of view, methods of sound generation should follow from, rather than guide, issues of structure. I focus on the more abstract layers of the compositional process, because I regard these concerns as nearly primary in relation to the nature of the activity of composing, and overridingly compelling as <i>reasons to compose </i>in the first place. I define &quot;progress&quot; as any development in the lucidity for myself of my creative aspirations. I borrow theory, concepts, and techniques as needed, for raw materials of creative exploration</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">For me, the ultimate appeal of the computer as a medium for composition lies not in its putative ability to produce &quot;any sound one can imagine&quot;, nor in its utility for automating and precisely executing process-complexes which would otherwise require a skilled human (or superhuman) contingent to faithfully carry out. The true allure of the computer beckons from the perennially extensible reaches of abstraction into which it can deliver the composer. Music can arise that makes its sense within worlds unimaginable or inaccessible without the participation of the computer. &quot;Getting there&quot; and &quot;being there&quot;, in terms of the making and experiencing of a piece of music, have a vividness that the computer, specifically, enables. The composer's journey from the first compositional urge, through all its ramifications and intermediary states, to the &quot;final piece&quot; (if such ever crystallizes) receives deep exposure, for the perusal of both composer and others, thanks to the hard documentary evidence of the computer code which undergirds the compositional endeavor. The required precision creates an exceptional potential for theoretical refinement and specialization.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">I embrace the implications of &quot;computer music&quot; <i>per se</i> more literally than other approaches which pick from the resource kit of the computer only those concepts and methods which seem most serviceable to non-computer modes and habits of music composition. I pursue the aspects of computer composition unique to the world of the computer, even to the extent of ignoring altogether the traditional concerns of composition.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">A large gap separates &quot;new sounds&quot; from &quot;new music&quot;. This problem looms particularly large for a computer composer who wishes to discover how to make a leap from clever synthesis algorithms to a <i>sui generic</i> piece without falling short upon a macrostructural arrangement of algorithm-objects that has less compositional intensity than the signal-level synthesis project has precision. While computer composers may create wildly original &quot;sounds&quot; and &quot;textures&quot;, the musical structure which holds these objets d'art together remains at best an imported formality or at worst an ad hoc assemblage. This is regrettable if one seeks not only new content, but also new meaning in &quot;new media&quot;.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">The interface a computer composer chooses exerts an indelible influence on the music produced. Awareness of the nature of this influence enables us to emphasize desirable aspects and avoid unwanted effects. Minimally, when composing with computers, I wish to tease out the conceptual framework that infuses the system in use. Better still, I may actively construct the conceptual framework itself. The computer affords a rare opportunity to describe not only what will happen, but exactly how it will happen, and indeed what that &quot;what&quot; &quot;is&quot;.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">For the purposes at hand, I view programming as a creative process in which, instead of predefining my goal(s) (e.g., to simulate a natural instrument) and then evaluating my subsequent work based upon how close it comes to the mark, I rather place my compositional aims <i>within </i>the feedback loop that includes my work with the computer and the output it provides me. So the question of how to make the sound of a drawing (or some other input) avoids tautological concerns of <i>could</i> or <i>should</i>-becoming, in fact, even <i>more</i> than a determination of how I <i>want</i> to interpret it-and reveals itself instead as a matter (not a question or a determination) of how it <i>happens that it gets interpreted</i>, as an integral fact of the story of the entire compositional endeavor.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">					<center>						<a name="fig1"></a><img src="tract.gif" width="396" height="300" alt="tract curve"></center>				</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">					<center>						<b>Figure 1</b></center>				</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">I regarded the curve I drew, pictured above (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), as the image of the piece I would compose. I set myself the imperative to discover the curve's music through the development of a system characterized as a) &quot;organic&quot; in its relationship to the drawing, b) as &quot;self-contextual&quot; as possible, and c) where not purely self-contextual, at least not arbitrary in its borrowed forms. As an expression of compositional aims, this statement functions as a means of focusing my project metaphorically and conceptually.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">Determining how my program might read the image required that I define an attitude about my view of the drawing. I decided that this drawing did not suggest an &quot;<i>x-y</i> graph&quot; that plots the change in one value on one axis against the change in another value, least of all a &quot;something over <i>time</i>&quot; graph. Instead it looked to me like a path: a path for one to follow as though one travels along the line: turning with it, speeding up and slowing down with it, feeling the motion internally as one feels music. One approach to the interpretation of this concept mathematically, working solely from the image, might read the path as a parametric curve, in which a third vector-call it <font face="Symbol">t</font>-moves along the line, itself an ordered list of (<i>x, y</i>) coordinate pairs. My reading of this curve by laying it onto ruled paper, measuring coordinates at regularly spaced intervals starting at the left endpoint of the curve, yielded a table of values which began:</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<div align="left">			<p>			<table cellspacing="0" border="1" width="132" align="CENTER">				<tr>					<th width="30%" valign="middle" align="left"><font face="Symbol" size="2"><i><b>t</b></i></font></th>					<th width="35%" valign="middle" align="left"><font size="2"><i><b>x</b></i></font></th>					<th width="35%" valign="middle" align="left"><font size="2"><i><b>y</b></i></font></th>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">0</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">230</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">377</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">1</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">245</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">378</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">2</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">269</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">381</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">3</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">306</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">392</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">4</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">298</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">409</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">5</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">303</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">424</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">6</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">305</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">446</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">7</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">305</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">463</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">8</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">304</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">486</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">10</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">300</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">508</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">11</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">305</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">523</font></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="30%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">12</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">300</font></td>					<td width="35%" valign="middle"><font face="Courier" size="2">540 </font></td>				</tr>			</table>			</p>		</div>		<p>		<table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="7" width="550">			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">This data table had two properties which seemed useful to the structuring of a &quot;self-contextual&quot; system: the values in each of the coordinate pairs <i>related to each other</i> meaningfully-i.e., &quot;<font face="Symbol">t</font>-meaningfully&quot;-and the <i>order</i> of the coordinate pairs factored equally critically in the &quot;meaning&quot; of the datafield as a whole.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">I interpreted this as a diagram of a time structure, from at out-of-time perspective. I envisioned a particle or a being moving along the curve, as <font face="Symbol">t</font>, at perhaps even a constant rate, in a path described by the (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)-pair data table. I imagined that this particle/organism might, for instance, experience inertial forces due to the angle of its motion, thus altering its speed, changing its &quot;muscle tension&quot;, etc. By viewing the changes in (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>) pairs through <font face="Symbol">t</font>, I saw that I gained a systemic view of the situation in which <font face="Symbol">t</font> functioned as a <i>time shape</i>, rather than as a mere &quot;axis of time&quot;. The available data might look skeletal, but the extrapolative approach held promise.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">The matter of reading the drawing thus became a task of assigning correspondences between the curve and the <i>music</i> in development, rather than between the curve and &quot;the sound&quot;. The drawing would determine all the different aspects of the eventual sound. I might pull some values directly; I might derive others as secondary or tertiary results of more direct measurements. I began simply by deriving pitch values from both the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates (the very thought!). By choosing to use pitches rather than frequency values, I strengthened the relational qualities within the curve. Although I introduced a registral dimension later in the construction of the piece, for the initial reading I left the pitch range open (i.e., classless).</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">I regarded this first reading of the curve as only a start: the reference-background for the music. With the aid of the Cscore functions, my prototype C program generated a score, and a simple Csound orchestra synthesized the crudest sonic sketch. This first result, a pair of plodding parallel pitch-successions, each at least as noncommittal on its own as a walking bass stripped of its context, already suggested intervallic systematization, but still manifested a good bit less than a full harmonic system.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">I had already decided that &quot;note&quot; durations, dynamics and timbre, apparent spatial locations, and all other qualities would derive from the same curve. I sought multiple ways of reading the same data which stayed consistent with the initial &quot;organic&quot; metaphor of a moving body. For example, notes in a tighter part of the curve might happen faster-or have shorter durations-than those in looser segments. Quantizing these durations would add a dimension of relative meaning among the notes. I developed timbre in a similar way, by generating spectral profiles according to, for instance, the comparison between the durational and pitch aspects of a note against its immediate neighbors. I derived all other qualities of the initial notelist in a similar manner. (See <a href="src-html/instr_1.c.html">instrument 1</a>.)</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">I laid the subsequent course of this enterprise as the enfolding of more and more articulations into the whole of the becoming-music by means of secondary process layers that would get generated along with the already severalfold recursively-derived qualities. The process which grew into my C program, <a href="bushrev/src-html/subsub.html"><i>subsub</i></a>, began as a substitution or &quot;enriching&quot; process, using a method called &quot;reach&quot; which constructed the sound musically: extrapolating enriched versions of the curve-directed reference background by using the curve to guide successive selection and transformation of segments of the originary material.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">Although I used conventional terms and synthesis methods, I employed them with different aims. I approached the creation of the total sound as a multi-level, multi-scale, evolutionary whole-piece process. This method differed greatly from ornamentation in that the latter usually makes little intrusion upon the time-structure of the music being &quot;gussied up&quot;, whereas my process treated all temporal qualities of the proto-musical material being enriched as just as malleable as harmonic and other qualities, recognizing &quot;harmonic&quot;, &quot;rhythmic&quot;, and other aspects of music as truly inseparable from &quot;time&quot;.

A strong sense of &quot;a way of happening&quot; pervades all of the versions of this piece. I attribute this to the structural-metaphorical focus of my compositional attention to the project. The music of <i>tract/intract </i>seems a very &quot;inner&quot; sort. Its reference-structures so tightly interweave with one another to form the fabric of the music, with no associative acknowledgements to an other world either in outer signs or inner pulses, that its nature seems inexplicable, its motives dubitable.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">I feel that this project has made great strides in exploring new concepts of synthesis that encompass a wider range of the computer-aided music composing project than low-level sound phenomena.

Like methods of sound synthesis, methods of temporal synthesis comprise a varied and expandable set of tools, some of which may have application only in a single creative work. Unlike methods of sound synthesis, methods of temporal synthesis cannot easily quantify their &quot;effects&quot; or proper use. Composing with methods of temporal synthesis necessitates an all-or-nothing approach in that rather than employing techniques priorly made available for application, the composer must develop a temporal meta-construct that pervades the entire work. Specific processes manifest as coded incarnations of the originary form.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">Temporal synthesis rejects the notion of time as a medium in which static objects flow or get arranged. If the media in use do not possess enough permeability to fuse with the temporal meta-construct, then they cannot serve as appropriate media for temporal synthesis. This makes music in sound the ideal medium for temporal synthesis. The methods of temporal synthesis used in a musical work must lie on a continuum with the sound synthesis methods, so that the composition of the time truly begins at zero. Works of temporal synthesis demand for their full realization an open-ended composing schedule, and require that the composer attentively follow through all of the implications of the overall concept.</td>			</tr>			<tr>				<td valign="top" colspan="45">The promise of faster and more efficient computer processors holds one part of the key to the proliferation of works of temporal synthesis. But far greater importance lies with the interface used by the computer composer. An environment like Csound, supplemented by custom C language modules, provides a theoretical &quot;clean room&quot; in which to construct systems which aim for the organic self-contextuality of temporal synthesis. Maintaining low-level access to the parameters of sound generation, and providing a wide variety of algorithms with the ability to expand at any time, permits the composer to build temporal structure into a musical work at the lowest level of relevance. Here lies the open door to future works of undreamt experiential substance and quality.</td>			</tr>		</table>		</p>		<p>&nbsp;	</body></html>
